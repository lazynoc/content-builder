      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The Levant is an old term referring to countries of the eastern Mediterranean. Some scholars include in it Cyprus and a small part of Turkey. But basically the Levant has throughout history meant Syria, Lebanon and Palestine. This means Jordan, the West Bank (now under Israeli occupation) and Israel itself are part of the Levant.",

      "question_text": "With reference to India, consider the following statements:\n1. Monazite is a source of rare earths.\n2. Monazite contains thorium.\n3. Monazite occurs naturally in the entire Indian coastal sands in India.\n4. In India, Government bodies only can process or export monazite.\nWhich of the statements given above are correct ?\n(a) 1, 2 and 3 only\n(b) 1, 2 and 4 only\n(c) 3 and 4 only\n(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4",
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Statement 1 is correct: Monazite is a primarily reddish-brown phosphate mineral that contains rare-earth elements. Due to variability in composition, monazite is considered a group of minerals.\nStatement 2 is correct: In addition to the rare-earth elements, thorium (Th) can be extracted from monazite ore. Thorium is a slightly radioactive metal, identical to uranium.\nStatement 3 is not correct: Atomic Minerals Directorate for Exploration and Research (AMD), a constitute unit of Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) has estimated the presence of 11.93 million tonnes of monazite resources...\nStatement 4 is correct: Monazite is a mineral mainly containing rare earths and thorium-a prescribed substance to be handled by the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE). Accordingly, Indian Rare Earths Ltd. (IREL) wholly owned by the Govt. of India, under the administrative control of the Dept. of Atomic Energy (DAE) utilises monazite mainly for production of rare earth compounds, and thorium, as needed in the Department of Atomic Energy.",

      "question_text": "Which of the following are nitrogen-fixing plants?\n1. Alfalfa\n2. Amarnath\n3. Chickpea\n4. Clover\n5. Purslane (Kulfa)\n6. Spinach\nSelect the correct answer using the code given below:\n(a) 1, 3 and 4 only\n(b) 1, 3, 5 and 6 only\n(c) 2, 4, 5 and 6 only\n(d) 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6",
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Alfalfa, also called lucerne, is a perennial flowering plant in the legume family Fabaceae. It is cultivated as an important forage crop in many countries around the world. Symbiotic N2 fixation by alfalfa provides substantial amounts of nitrogen ( N ) to livestock operations, subsequent crops, and soil organic matter. Hence option 1 is correct.\nAmaranthus is a cosmopolitan genus of annual or short-lived perennial plants collectively known as amaranths. Hence option 2 is not correct.\nChickpea: The chickpea or chick pea is an annual legume of the family Fabaceae. Hence option 3 is correct.\nClover: Nitrogen is \"fixed\" in clovers through a symbiotic relationship with Rhizobium bacteria that infects the plant's roots. Hence option 4 is correct.\nPurslane: Purslane is a green, leafy vegetable that can be eaten raw or cooked. It is known scientifically as Portulaca oleracea, and is also called pigweed, little hogweed, fatweed and pusley. This succulent plant contains about 93% water. It has red stems and small, green leaves. Hence option 5 is not correct.\nSpinach: Spinach is a leafy green flowering plant native to central and western Asia. It is of the order Caryophyllales, family Amaranthaceae. Hence option 6 is not correct.",
