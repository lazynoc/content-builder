      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Recent context: The Finance minister of Sri Lanka has started bailout talks with the lender of last resort (IMF) and seeking IMF's rapid financial assistance to tackle growing shortages of food, fuel and medicines. The Rapid Financing Instrument (RFI) provides rapid financial assistance, which is available to all member countries facing an urgent balance of payments need. The RFI was created as part of a broader reform to make the IMF's financial support more flexible to address the diverse needs of member countries. The RFI replaced the IMF's previous emergency assistance policy and can be used in a wide range of circumstances.\nFinancial assistance under the RFI is provided in the form of outright purchases without the need for a fullfledged program or reviews. A member country requesting RFI assistance is required to cooperate with the IMF to make efforts to solve its balance of payments difficulties and to describe the general economic policies that it proposes to follow. Prior actions may be required where warranted.\nThe Rapid Credit Facility (RCF) of IMF provides rapid concessional financial assistance to low-income countries (LICs) facing an urgent balance of payments (BoP) need with no ex post conditionality where a fullfledged economic program is neither necessary nor feasible. The RCF was created under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT) as part of a broader reform to make the Fund's financial support more flexible and better tailored to the diverse needs of LICs, including in times of crisis.\nHence option (b) is the current answer.",

      "question_text": "With reference to the Indian economy, consider the following statements :\n1. An increase in Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) indicates the appreciation of rupee.\n2. An increase in the Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) indicates an improvement in trade competitiveness.\n3. An increasing trend in domestic inflation relative to inflation in other countries is likely to cause an increasing divergence between NEER and REER.\nWhich of the above statements are correct?\n(a) 1 and 2 only\n(b) 2 and 3 only\n(c) 1 and 3 only\n(d) 1, 2 and 3",
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) is a measure of the value of a currency against a weighted average of several foreign currencies. The nominal exchange rate is the amount of domestic currency needed to purchase foreign currency. If a domestic currency increases against a basket of other currencies inside a floating exchange rate regime, NEER is said to appreciate. If the domestic currency falls against the basket, the NEER depreciates. An increase in NEER indicates an appreciation of the local currency against the weighted basket of currencies of its trading partners. Hence statement 1 is correct.\nReal Effective Exchange Rate (REER) is the real effective exchange rate (a measure of the value of a currency against a weighted average of several foreign currencies) divided by a price deflator or index of costs. In simple words, a nation's nominal effective exchange rate (NEER), adjusted for inflation in the home country, equals its real effective exchange rate (REER). An increase in REER implies that exports become more expensive and imports become cheaper; therefore, an increase indicates a loss in trade competitiveness. Hence statement 2 is not correct.\nREER is the NEER after factoring in relative inflation (consumer price-based index) using some measure of relative prices or costs; changes in the REER thus take into account both nominal exchange rate changes and the inflation differential vis-Ã -vis trading partners. Soaring inflation will impact REER, which, in turn, would inevitably push up the cost of merchandise and affect competitiveness of Indian exports. Thus, if inflation is in an increasing trend in domestic nation relative to inflation in other countries, there is likely to cause an increasing divergence between NEER and REER. For instance, considering NEER and REER values between April 2019 and May 2021 in India, the NEER has been mostly declining, whereas, REER remains in sync with the inflationary trends-the upward biases in REER due to inflation was already being felt in May 2021. The increasing difference between trends of NEER and REER in the last 26 months was due to India's domestic inflation being higher relative to the six major currencies considered. Hence statement 3 is correct.",

If RBI feels inflation is too high, it will sell government securities, and suck money out of the system. This act will push up interest rates in the economy, and business will cut back on capital expenditure financed by loans, reducing the demand for money. Hence statement 1 is not correct.\nCentral banks also intervene periodically in foreign exchange markets. If the rupee is rapidly depreciating, RBI will sell dollars in the market.

      "question_text": "With reference to the Indian economy, what are the advantages of \"Inflation-Indexed Bonds (IIBs)\"?\n1. Government can reduce the coupon rates on its borrowing by way of IIBs.\n2. IIBs provide protection to the investors from uncertainty regarding inflation.\n3. The interest received as well as capital gains on IIBs are not taxable.\nWhich of the statements given above are correct?\n(a) 1 and 2 only\n(b) 2 and 3 only\n(c) 1 and 3 only\n(d) 1, 2 and 3",
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Inflation-indexed bonds in India were issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in 2013 and were benchmarked to Wholesale Price Index (WPI). Inflation-indexed bonds are financial instruments that attempt to protect the bonds' purchasing power by tying interest and principal payments to an index of price changes. Indexed bonds include two types of compensation, a real rate of return plus a compensation for the erosion of purchasing power. Inflation component on principal will not be paid with interest but the same would be adjusted in the principal by multiplying principal with index ratio (IR). At the time of redemption, adjusted principal or the face, whichever is higher, would be paid. Interest rate will be provided protection against inflation by paying fixed coupon rate on the principal adjusted against inflation. Hence statement 2 is correct.\nEconomists have argued that inflation indexed bonds could reduce government borrowing costs. If the market overestimates future inflation, government will reduce borrowing costs by issuing inflation indexed bonds rather than nominal bonds. This may occur because, for example, investors' expectations are not completely forward-looking or rational. Alternatively, the government, because it is able to influence inflation through its policies, may have better information about the future course of inflation, or perhaps has more faith in its commitment to contain it than the public does. In these cases a treasury can lower its costs by issuing indexed bonds. For example, if coupon rate of IIBs is fixed $1.5 \\%$ above WPI (Whole sale price index) and current WPI is $4 \\%$, so effective rate will be $5.5 \\%(4+1.5\\%)$. In future, when WPI falls from $4 \\%$ to $2 \\%$, then effective coupon rate will become $3.5 \\%$ (i.e. $2+1.5$ ) and thus government can reduce the coupon rates on its borrowing by way of IIBs through reducing inflationary trends. Hence statement 1 is correct.\nExtant tax provisions will be applicable on interest payment and capital gains on IIBs. There will be no special tax treatment for these bonds. Hence statement 3 is not correct.",

      "explanation": "Indirect transfers refer to situations where when foreign entities own shares or assets in India, the shares of such foreign entities are transferred instead of a direct transfer of the underlying assets in India. Hence option (d) is the correct answer.\nThe origin of retrospective taxation can be traced backed to 2012, When Vodafone Ltd. was retrospectively taxed by the Indian tax authorities for a 2007 deal. The 2012 act had amended the IT act to impose tax liability on the income earned from the sale of shares of a foreign company on a retrospective basis (i.e., also applicable to the transactions done before May 28, 2012). The amendments made by the 2012 Act clarified that if a company is registered or incorporated outside India, its shares will be deemed to be or have always been situated in India if they derive their value substantially from the assets located in India. As a result, the persons who sold such shares of foreign companies before the enactment of the Act (i.e., May 28, 2012) also became liable to pay tax on the income earned from such sale.\nThe Taxation Laws (Amendment) Act, 2021 nullifies the 'retrospective taxation' that was introduced with the Finance Act of 2012.

The recommendations, which the committee made, took note of the importance given to freedom of speech in the Constitution and of the need for safeguarding the status and dignity of courts and interests of administration of justice. Statement 2 is correct: Article 129 of the Constitution gives the Supreme Court the power to initiate contempt cases on its own, independent of the motion brought before it by the Attorney General (AG) or with the consent of the AG. Statement 3 is not correct and Statement 4 is correct: Contempt of court seeks to protect judicial institutions from motivated attacks and unwarranted criticism, and as a legal mechanism to punish those who lower its authority. The expression 'contempt of court' has not been defined by the Constitution. The Contempt of Court Act, 1971 defines both civil and criminal contempt. Hence the Parliament is vested with the powers to make laws regarding contempt of court.",
      "motivation": "Recently, Supreme Court held that No law can take away court's power to punish for contempt.",

Bar Councils have the power to lay down the rules relating to legal education and recognition of law colleges. Which of the statements given above is/are correct ? (a) 1 only (b) 2 only (c) Both 1 and 2 (d) Neither 1 nor 2",
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The role of the legal profession in society is manifoldâits members are flag-bearers of the rule of law and they defend fundamental rights. Along with these responsibilities, members of the legal profession have been conferred significant power and privileges as officers of the court. First, only advocates have the right to access and represent others in a court of law. No citizen, other than an advocate, has the right to appear, act, or plead in court. Second, in India, the term \"legal professionals\" refers only to those \"advocates\" who are law graduates and have been enrolled in state bar councils (SBCs). Statement 1 is not correct: An emerging class of legal professionals engaged with various law-related activities-such as government law officers, corporate lawyers, law firms, law professors, legal researchers, and patent attorneys-have been excluded from recognition as advocates. Third, the judiciary has clarified the otherwise undefined concept of \"practice of law\" to include all forms of legal activities, including both litigious and non-litigious work, such as appearing in court, drafting, giving opinions, performing transactional work, consulting, arbitrating, mediating, filing vakalatnamas (power of attorney), and working as legal officers. Thus, \"advocates\" enrolled in bar councils enjoy exclusive monopoly over the right to practise law in all courts, tribunals, and other authorities in India. Statement 2 is correct: The Advocates Act, 1961, enacted with the objective of creating \"a unified Bar for the whole country with monopoly in legal practice and autonomy in matters of professional management,\" conferred the Bar Council of India (BCI) and SBCs with the power to self-regulate the profession and lay down rules relating to admission and enrolment, conditions of practice, standards of professional conduct and etiquette, disciplinary proceedings, legal education, recognition of law colleges, and welfare activities. These powers were granted to the bar councils to promote the administration of justice and uphold the dignity of the profession in the eyes of the common people.",
      "motivation": "After widespread opposition from lawyers to the new rules of conduct notified by the Bar Council of India (BCI), the Council has now set up a review committee and announced that these rules will not be implemented for now. The new rules triggered a controversy as they seek to prevent lawyers from publicly criticising judges and bar councils.",

The next legislative attempt, in 1978, allowed independent and nominated legislators to join a political party once. With rising public opinion for an anti-defection law, immediately after securing a clear majority in 1984, the Rajiv Gandhi's government proposed the new anti-defection bill in the Parliament.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Solar flares occur when magnetic energy builds up in the solar atmosphere and is released suddenly. These outbursts are intrinsically linked to the solar cycle - an approximately 11-year cycle of solar activity driven by the sun's magnetic field. These are large explosions from the surface of the sun that emit intense bursts of electromagnetic radiation. According to NASA, harmful radiation from a flare cannot pass through Earth's atmosphere to physically affect humans on the ground. The solar flares, even the intense ones, do not pose an immediate threat to us, at least those who are within the Earth's atmosphere. Flares are not fires but outbursts of electromagnetic radiation. Thus they will not cause forest fires. Hence statement 5 is not correct. Tsunami is a purely seismic phenomenon. Earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and other underwater explosions (including detonations, landslides, glacier calvings, meteorite impacts and other disturbances) above or below water all have the potential to generate a tsunami and not solar flares. Hence statement 2 is not correct. By elimination technique, one can easily reach option (c). Hence option (c) is the correct answer.",

      "explanation": "The Cripps mission was an attempt in late March 1942 by the British government to secure full Indian cooperation and support for their efforts in World War II. The mission was headed by Sir Stafford Cripps, a senior left-wing politician and government minister in the War Cabinet, who had actively supported the Indian national movement.\nThe main proposals of the mission were as follows:\n- An Indian Union with a dominion status would be set up; it would be free to decide its relations with the Commonwealth.\n- After the end of the war, a Constituent Assembly would be convened to frame a new constitution. Members of this assembly would be partly elected by the provincial assemblies through proportional representation and partly nominated by the princes. Hence statement 1 is not correct.\n- The British government would accept the new constitution subject to two conditions: any province not willing to join the Union could have a separate constitution and form a separate Union, and the new constitution-making body and the British government would negotiate a treaty to effect the transfer of power and to safeguard racial and religious minorities. Hence statement 2 is correct.\nIn the meantime, defence of India would remain in British hands and the governor-general's powers would remain intact.",

The Mongols numbering 1,20,000 horsemen under the command of Targhi moved so swiftly that provincial governors could not get time to reach Delhi to help the Sultan.\nBesides, a large part of the army of Ala-ud-din had left for Telingana campaign and the army left at Delhi was insufficient and weak after its tough battle at Chittor. Therefore, Ala-ud-din was not in a position to face the Mongols in an open battle.\nHe retired to the fort of Siri and took up defensive position. The Mongols plundered the environs of Delhi and besieged the fort for two months. But as they were ignorant of the art of siege-warfare, they failed to capture the fort and withdrew.\nHence statement 3 is not correct:The next major Mongol invasion took place after the Khiljis had been replaced by the Tughlaq dynasty in the Sultanate. In 1327 the Mongols invaded under Tarmashirin. Historians have differed regard Muhammad Tughlaq's policy. According to one version, he defeated the Mongols and himself chased them to drive them out.

They captured Nagapatam near Madras (Chennai) from the Portuguese and made it their main stronghold in South India.\nThe Hindu Gajapati rulers (c. 1435 - 1541 CE) ruled over Kalinga (Odisha), large parts of Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal, and the eastern and central parts of Madhya Pradesh and Jharkhand.

Which of the statements given above are correct? (a) 1 and 2 only (b) 2 and 3 only (c) 1 and 3 only (d) 1, 2 and 3",
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Tight monetary policy implies the Central Bank (or authority in charge of Monetary Policy) is seeking to reduce the demand for money and limit the pace of economic expansion. Central banks engage in tight monetary policy when an economy is accelerating too quickly or inflation is rising too fast and usually involves increasing interest rates. Tight monetary policy of US Federal Reserve means hiking the federal funds rateâthe rate at which banks lend to each otherâincreases borrowing rates and slows lending. Rate increases make borrowing less attractive as interest payments increase. It affects all types of borrowing including personal loans, mortgages, and interest rates on credit cards. Faster Fed rate could rattle financial markets and tighten financial conditions globally especially in emerging market economies like India. For instance, an aggressive monetary tightening would raise US yields and strengthen the US dollar against EM currencies like rupee. As a result, US-based foreign portfolio investors/Foreign institutional investors investing in countries like India would pull money out from here and invest in \"safe haven\" US assets (Treasury bonds) and thus leading significant capital flight from India. Hence statement 1 is correct. The sudden stops and reversal of capital flows will lead to depreciation pressures on emerging market currencies like rupee. When foreign investors invest in equities, bonds and other financial assets in EMEs, they measure financial returns in the US dollar and other foreign currencies. If the EM currency depreciates against the US dollar, it decreases the value of their investments in dollar terms and, therefore, they may engage in distress sales of funds. This capital flight may increase interest cost of firms with a large stock of foreign currency debt as rising US dollar would increase the debt-servicing costs (in local currencies) for firms. Hence statement 2 is correct. Devaluation of domestic currency increases the currency risk associated with ECBs (as mostly foreign currency denominated). For instance, if at the time of raising loan through ECBs, 1 dollar was equal to Rs 75 and in future with depreciation/devaluation of domestic currency, 1 dollar becomes Rs 80. In this case, companies/firms done borrowing through ECBs would have to pay back more as converting more rupee with their dollar equivalent and in turn increases their currency risk. Hence statement 3 is not correct.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "A convertible bond is a fixed-income corporate debt security that yields interest payments, but can be converted into a predetermined number of common stock or equity shares. It offers investors a type of hybrid security that has features of a bond, such as interest payments, while also having the option to own the underlying stock. Issuing convertible bonds can help companies minimize negative investor sentiment that would surround equity issuance. Further, issuing convertible bonds can also help provide investors with some security in the event of default. A convertible bond protects investors' principal on the downside, but allows them to participate in the upside should the underlying company succeed. However, convertible bonds tend to offer a lower coupon rate or rate of return in exchange for the value of the option to convert the bond into common stock. Companies benefit since they can issue debt at lower interest rates than with traditional bond offerings. Hence statement 1 is correct. The option to convert to equity affords the bondholder a degree of indexation to rising consumer prices. As indexation will ensure that prices are adjusted with inflation over a period of time. With the help of indexation, bondholders will be able to lower their long-term capital gains (as their investment will be adjusted with inflation) even when converting bonds into equity, which brings down their taxable income.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Vietnam is a one-party communist state, not a multi-party parliamentary democracy. Hence statement 2 is not correct. Vietnam's open economic policy of recent years integrating into global supply chains has made the growth success story possible in recent years. Vietnam's export-led growth strategy and global integration are among the key factors behind the country's remarkable achievements in growth and poverty. Between 2002 and 2021, GDP per capita increased 3.6 times, reaching almost US$3,700. Poverty rates declined sharply from over 32 percent in 2011 to below 2 percent today. Thanks to its solid foundations, the economy has proven resilient through different crises, the latest being COVID-19. Vietnam was one of only a few countries to post GDP growth in 2020 when the pandemic hit. Vietnam is projected to be the fastest-growing internet economy in Southeast Asia in the next 10 years. Hence statements 1 and 3 are correct. Thanks to an abundance of low-wage labour, Vietnam's manufacturing sector grew at a compound annual growth in the last decade. As the rest of East Asia developed and wages there rose, global manufacturers were lured by Vietnam's low labour costs and stable exchange rate. Hence statement 4 is correct. According to Asian Development Bank Report, e-services including digital financial services are at a very nascent stage in Vietnam. Vietnamese fintech companies raised a total of US $375 million in the first nine months of 2021, putting the country at the 3rd position in fintech investment amount across ASEAN, behind only Singapore and Indonesia.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is vested with the responsibility of conducting monetary policy. This responsibility is explicitly mandated under the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934. The primary objective of monetary policy is to maintain price stability while keeping in mind the objective of growth. Price stability is a necessary precondition to sustainable growth. The MPC (Monetary Policy Committee) determines the policy interest rate required to achieve the inflation target. The Reserve Bank's Monetary Policy Department (MPD) assists the MPC in formulating the monetary policy. Views of key stakeholders in the economy, and analytical work of the Reserve Bank contribute to the process for arriving at the decision on the policy repo rate. The Financial Markets Operations Department (FMOD) of RBI operationalises the monetary policy, mainly through day-to-day liquidity management operations. The Financial Markets Committee (FMC) meets daily to review the liquidity conditions so as to ensure that the operating target of the weighted average call money rate (WACR) is aligned with the repo rate. There are several direct and indirect instruments that are used by RBI for implementing monetary policy for price stability by keeping check on inflation such as Repo rate, Reverse repo, Open market operations, Liquidity adjustment facility, etc. For example, RBI does it by increasing the repo rate in the economy, if inflation is high. Increase in interest rate is believed to bring down the inflation level in the economy by curtailing the amount of economic activity whereas decreasing the interest rate increases the inflation level of the economy by increasing the economic activity. Hence option (d) is the correct answer.",

For instance, if you hold one crypto token, say one Ethereum, the next Ethereum that you hold will also be of the same value. But NFTs are non-fungible, that means the value of one NFT is not equal to another. Every art is different from other, making it non-fungible, and unique.

      "explanation": "Coal controller organization (earlier Coal Commissioner), established in 1916, is one of the oldest offices in Indian Coal sector. Main aim behind setting up this office was to have Government control to adequately meet the coal requirement during First World War. Acute scarcity of coal necessitated promulgation of Colliery Control Order, 1944 for effective control on production, distribution and pricing of coal. Subsequently, it was revised by a more comprehensive order in 1945. Later in 1996, distribution and pricing of coal was deregulated. Thereafter, Colliery Control Order, 2000 superseded the previous order. Finally, the Colliery Control Rules, 2004, was published by Government of India in August, 2004. Functions of Coal Controller's Organization (i) Under Colliery Control Rules, 2004: (a) To lay down procedure and standard for sampling of coal. (b) Inspection of collieries so as to ensure the correctness of the class, grade or size of coal. (c) To issue directives for the purpose of declaration and maintenance of grades of coal of a seam mined in a colliery. (d) To act as the appellate authority in case of dispute between consumers and owner arising out of declaration of grade and size of coal. (e) To regulate disposal of stock of coal or the expected output of coal in the colliery. (f) Quality surveillance with respect to maintenance of grade, loading of coal in wagons/ trucks according to laid down procedures regarding grades and sizes. (g) To grant opening / re-opening permission of coal mine, seam or a section of seam or to subdivide a mine. (ii) Under Collection of Statistics Act, 2008: (a) Coal Controller has been made the statistical authority with respect to coal and lignite statistics. Hence statement 1 is correct. (b) Entrusted the responsibility of carrying out Annual Coal & Lignite survey and publishing of Provisional Coal Statistics and Coal Directory of India. (c) Submission of monthly coal data to different ministries of central and state Govt., national and international organization. (d) Collection of Statistics relating to coal washeries. (iii) Under Coal Bearing Area (Acquisition and Development) Act, 1957: Coal Controller is the competent authority under this act to hear any objection to the Central Government's Notification relating to acquisition of coal bearing land and to furnish his reports to Central Govt.

In a significant verdict in 2012, the Bombay High Court has ruled that wild animals including tiger should be treated as 'government property for all purposes'.\nStatement 2 is correct: The law governing the subject of wildlife, the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, does not discriminate between animals found in protected areas and outside. It provides for equal protection for wild animals irrespective of where they are found. The WLPA prohibits people from hunting wildlife, provides legal safeguards for different species based on their threat status, regulates trade and commerce in wild species, imposes penalties for wildlife-related crimes and specifies the terms to declare protected areas.\nStatement 3 is not correct: Only if the wild animal becomes a danger to human life or is diseased or disabled beyond recovery can it be allowed to be captured or killed by the competent authority, the Chief Wildlife Warden of the State. This provision is applicable to wild animals listed in Schedule I of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, which includes leopards.

Nagabhata I, Nagabhata II, Mihir Bhoj or Bhoja and Mahendrapala were the other important rulers of the dynasty. The expansion of the Gurjara-Pratihara kingdom involved constant conflicts with other contemporary powers such as the Palas and the Rashtrakutas known as the tripartite struggle over the city of Kannauj. Dantidurga was the founder of the dynasty called, Rashtrakuta dynasty (8th century AD). The capital of the Rastrakutas was Manyakheta or Malkhed near Sholapur. Dhruva-I, Krishna-I and Amoghavarsha were the other important rulers of this dynasty. The Chandela or Chandel was Indian Rajput clan of Central India. They were popularly termed as Chandelas or Jejakabhukti dynasty in Indian history. Nannuk, a ruler of small kingdom was the founder of Chandela Dynasty. Khajuraho was a strong hold of Nannuk who was considered as the chief of his clan. Vakapati succeeded his father in the first quarter of tenth century. Vakapati had to often assist Pratiharas in the battle field, as he was a liegeman of them. Some inscriptions prove that his territory extended till Vindhya hills. Jaishakti, the elder son, succeeded the throne and was successful in extending his empire. Jaishakti, the elder brother who ruled first, was also called Jai Jak and from this name the region ruled by the Chandelas acquired the name of Jaijikbhukti.

The contents of Vasistha's teaching to Rama is associated with Advaita Vedanta, the illusory nature of the manifest world and the principle of nonduality. The book has been dated between the 11th and 14th century AD) and is generally regarded as one of the longest texts in Sanskrit (after the Mahabharata) and an important text of Yoga. The book consists of about 32,000 shlokas (lines), including numerous short stories and anecdotes used to help illustrate its content.\n\nOriginally written in Sanskrit, the Yoga Vasistha has been translated into most Indian languages, and the stories are told to children in various forms. The number of Muslim scholars who collaborated with Hindu pandits in making Sanskrit works available was considerable. During the Moghul Dynasty the text was translated into Persian several times, as ordered by Akbar, Jahangir and Darah Shikoh.\nNizam al-Din Panipati rendered the widely influential Yoga Vasistha into Persian late in the sixteenth century at the behest of the Mughal ruler Jahangir while he was still a crown prince.

(b) They alleviate the body's pain and inflammation. (c) They act as immunosuppressants in the body. (d) They protect the body from the diseases caused by pathogens.",
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The overall ability of the body to fight the diseasecausing organisms (pathogens), conferred by the immune system is called immunity. The primary and secondary immune responses are carried out with the help of two special types of lymphocytes present in our blood, i.e., B-lymphocytes (B-cells) and T-lymphocytes (T-cells). Thus, both B-cells and T-cells are responsible for acquired immunity. B-cells are responsible for antibody-mediated immunity response. T-cells are responsible for cell-mediated immunity response. Bcells produce antibodies to fight with the pathogens into our blood. The T-cells themselves do not secrete antibodies but help B cells produce them. Hence option (d) is the correct answer.",

      "question_text": "Consider the following statements: 1. Other than those made by humans, nanoparticles do not exist in nature. 2. Nanoparticles of some metallic oxides are used in the manufacture of some cosmetics. 3. Nanoparticles of some commercial products which enter the environment are unsafe for humans. Which of the statements given above is/are correct? (a) 1 only (b) 3 only (c) 1 and 2 (d) 2 and 3",
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "A nanoparticle is a small particle that ranges between 1 to 100 nanometres in size (diameter). Undetectable by the human eye, nanoparticles can exhibit significantly different physical and chemical properties to their larger material counterparts. Being much smaller than the wavelengths of visible light (400-700 nm), nanoparticles cannot be seen with ordinary optical microscopes, requiring the use of electron microscopes or microscopes with laser. Nanoparticles occur widely in nature and are objects of study in many sciences such as chemistry, physics, geology and biology. A significant fraction (by number, if not by mass) of interplanetary dust, that is still falling on the Earth at the rate of thousands of tons per year, is in the nanoparticle range; and the same is true of atmospheric dust particles. Many viruses have diameters in the nanoparticle range. Iron oxides/sulfides, silver, and gold are some of the representative examples of naturally-occurring nanoparticles in the environment. Hence statement 1 is not correct. Many cosmetic products used in our daily life are made with the assistance of nanotechnologies. Among metal and metal oxide nanoparticles (NPs) potentially present in cosmetics, those containing titanium dioxide and zinc oxide are common ingredients added to obtain a sufficient sun protection. The addition of silver and gold NPs is also mentioned to increase the antimicrobial and healing properties of some cosmetic formulations. Hence statement 2 is correct. The exposure of nanoparticle to environment and human can be described through different mechanisms. Primarily occupational exposures occur to workers (including engineers, scientists, and technicians) during the research-scale synthesis and commercial production of nanomaterial-based products. This exposure mainly results from handling of raw materials while carrying out reactions through the equipment. Characterization of resulting material, packing, and transportation can be other sources of this type of exposure. At the second stage, consumers are exposed to such nanomaterial during usage and application and it may lead to harmful and toxic effects. Hence statement 3 is correct.",

Which of the statements given above is/are correct? (a) 1 only (b) 3 only (c) 1 and 2 (d) 2 and 3",
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "DNA barcoding is the identification of a species by the characteristic sequence of a standard short section of DNA in its genome. DNA barcoding is done by comparing an individual DNA sequence with a reference library of such DNA sections (called sequences). The introduction of DNA barcoding represents a promising approach for food authentication, being broadly applied in fish species. DNA barcoding has been successful when applied to seafood because the number of species is high in comparison to other animal sources, such as cattle, sheep, goat, and horse, enhancing the effectiveness of the approach. DNA barcoding techniques were used to explore the composition of roasted barley tea (Hordeum vulgare), which was exported to a certain country from China but then returned, due to the detection of other undesirable plant components present. Contaminants were found. Hence option 3 is correct. DNA barcoding will allow users to efficiently recognize known species and speed the discovery of species yet to be found in nature. There have been reports of DNA barcodes used in distinguishing species of tropical Lepidoptera (an order of insects that includes butterflies and moths which are similar). DNA barcodes effectively distinguish among species in three Lepidoptera families from Area de ConservaciÃ³n Guanacaste in northwestern Costa Rica. Hence option 2 is correct.",
