      "question_text": "How many Delimitation Commissions have been constituted by the Government of India till December 2023?",
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Delimitation literally means the act or process of fixing limits or boundaries of territorial constituencies in a country or a province having a legislative body. The job of delimitation is assigned to a high power body. Such a body is known as Delimitation Commission or a Boundary Commission. In India, such Delimitation Commissions have been constituted 4 times - in 1952 under the Delimitation Commission Act, 1952, in 1963 under Delimitation Commission Act, 1962, in 1973 under Delimitation Act, 1972 and in 2002 under Delimitation Act, 2002. Hence, option (d) is the correct answer. The Delimitation Commission in India is a high power body whose orders have the force of law and cannot be called in question before any court. These orders come into force on a date to be specified by the President of India in this behalf. The copies of its orders are laid before the House of the People and the State Legislative Assembly concerned, but no modifications are permissible therein by them.",

Its three founding members were Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, Balraj Madhok and Deendayal Upadhyaya. Hence pair 1 is correctly matched. C. Rajagopalachari was the founder of the Swatantra Party, not the Socialist Party. The Socialist Party was associated with leaders like Ram Manohar Lohia and Jayaprakash Narayan. Hence pair 2 is not correctly matched. The Congress for Democracy (CFD) was an Indian political party founded in 1977 by Jagjivan Ram. It was formed after Jagjivan Ram, Hemavati Nandan Bahuguna, and Nandini Satpathy left the Indian National Congress of Indira Gandhi and denounced her rule during the Indian Emergency. Hence pair 3 is correctly matched. The Swatantra Party was an Indian classical liberal political party that existed from 1959 to 1974. It was founded by C. Rajagopalachari in reaction to what he felt was the Jawaharlal Nehru-dominated Indian National Congress's increasingly socialist and statist outlook. Hence pair 4 is not correctly matched.

This Committee cannot take up any matter which is sub-judice.\nSelect the correct answer using the code given below:",
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The Ethics Committee of the Lok Sabha and its History:\nThe genesis of the formation of the Ethics Committee in Parliament can be traced to a resolution adopted at the Presiding Officers Conference held in New Delhi in October 1996 which desired the legislatures to explore the possibility of constituting an Ethics Committee. It is in pursuance of this resolution that the endeavour for setting up of the Ethics Committee in Indian Legislatures began in earnest.\nThen Vice President (and Rajya Sabha Chairman) K R Narayanan constituted the Ethics Committee of the Upper House on March 4, 1997, and it was inaugurated that May to oversee the moral and ethical conduct of members and examine cases of misconduct referred to it. The Rules applicable to the Committee of Privileges also apply to the ethics panel.\nIn the case of Lok Sabha, a study group of the House Committee of Privileges, after visiting Australia, the UK, and the US in 1997 to look into practices pertaining to the conduct and ethics of legislators, recommended the constitution of an Ethics Committee, but it could not be taken up by Lok Sabha. The Committee of Privileges finally recommended the constitution of an Ethics Committee during the 13th Lok Sabha. The late Speaker, G M C Balayogi, constituted an ad hoc Ethics Committee in 2000, which became a permanent part of the House only in 2015. Hence, statement 1 is correct.\nAny person can complain against a Member through another Lok Sabha MP, along with evidence of the alleged misconduct, and an affidavit stating that the complaint is not \"false, frivolous, or vexatious\". If the Member himself complains, the affidavit is not needed. The Speaker can refer to the Committee any complaint against an MP. Hence, statement 2 is not correct.\nThe Committee does not entertain complaints based only on media reports or on matters that are sub judice. The Committee makes a prima facie inquiry before deciding to examine a complaint. It makes its recommendations after evaluating the complaint. Hence, statement 3 is correct.",

In the first century B.C. the Buddhist monks, Dharmaratna and Kasyapa Matanga, went to China and spent the rest of their lives there translating Buddhist texts into Chinese and preaching Buddhism among the people. By the third or the fourth century A.D., Buddhism became a widely popular religion in China. Afterwards too many Buddhist missionaries like Kumarajiva, Sangabhuti. Gyanabhadra, Buddhbhadra, Jiva Gupta, Dharma Gupta, Prabhakaramitra, Sudhakarasingha, etc., went to China. The same way, many Chinese pilgrims came to India, the most important of them being Fa-Hien, Hiuen-Tsang and I- tsing. Sangabhuti was the author of the commentary on the Sarvastivada Vinaya.",

Like Japan, Italy is known for its ageing population. More than $23 \\%$ of people there were over the age of 65 in 2019, according to World Bank data. - Nigeria and other countries in Africa are bucking the trend of population decline. Nigeria will become the world's second most populous country, with 791 million people. The new study predicts that Nigeria will have one of the largest working-age populations in the world by 2100 and see big increases in GDP. - South Korea's demographic crisis has become the top risk to economic growth and the social welfare system, with the country's population of 51 million on track to halve by the end of this century.

Fighting between the army, headed by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), led by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, since last April has killed tens of thousands of people, as the threat of famine looms amid international inaction. Hence pair 2 is correctly matched.\n- No, Turkey has not Rescinded its membership of NATO. But some countries think turkey can be a Trojan horse for NATO and block consensus on every decision until NATO members meet his price. Turkey today is a liability. There is no mechanism within NATO to expel a wayward member. In the past, countries withdrew voluntarily. Hence pair 3 is not correctly matched. Hence option (b) is the correct answer.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "As the national debt has soared, the U.S. Treasury Department has had to borrow more money to pay for government spending by revoking the Debt ceiling. The debt ceiling sets the maximum amount of outstanding federal debt the U.S. government can incur.\nRaising or suspending the debt ceiling by US Congress becomes necessary when the government needs to borrow more money to pay its debts than is federally authorized. If Congress fails to lift the debt ceiling before the due date when the Treasury will run out of cash—the federal government will not be able to pay its obligations. Further, if United States of America (USA) were to default on its debt, holders of US Treasury Bonds will not be able to exercise their claims to receive payment. Hence statement-I is correct.\nFurther, the Currencies like US dollars are fiat currency. Fiat money is a government-issued currency that is not backed by a physical commodity, such as gold or silver, but rather by the government that issued it. The value of fiat money is derived from the relationship between supply and demand and the stability of the issuing government, rather than the worth of a commodity backing it. Furthermore, if people lose faith in a nation's currency, the money will no longer hold value. So, Treasury Bonds issued by US government are not backed by any hard assets but based on only faith of the government and if government fails to repay the debt taken, then bond holders would not have right to exercise their claims to receive payment. Hence statement-II is correct and it is the correct explanation of statement-I.",

It is a sovereign currency issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in alignment with its monetary policy.\n2. It appears as a liability on the RBI's balance sheet.\n3. It is insured against inflation by its very design.\n4. It is freely convertible against commercial bank money and cash.\nWhich of the statements given above are correct?",
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Reserve Bank of India defines CBDC as the legal tender issued by a central bank in a digital form. It is the same as a sovereign currency and is exchangeable one-to-one at par (1:1) with the fiat currency. While money in digital form is predominant in India-for example in bank accounts recorded as book entries on commercial bank ledgers-a CBDC would differ from existing digital money available to the public because a CBDC would be a liability of the Reserve Bank, and not of a commercial bank.\nThe features of CBDC include:\n- CBDC is sovereign currency issued by Central Banks in alignment with their monetary policy. Hence statement 1 is correct.\n- It appears as a liability on the central bank's balance sheet. Hence statement 2 is correct.\n- Must be accepted as a medium of payment, legal tender, and a safe store of value by all citizens, enterprises, and government agencies.\n- Freely convertible against commercial bank money and cash. Hence statement 4 is correct.\nCBDC like the physical currency is not inherently insured against inflation. However, the data collected through CBDCs has the potential to be paired with strict reserve requirements for commercial banks, creating a theoretical framework for inflation control. Hence statement 3 is not correct.",

The date of the Mangadu megaliths is approximately from 1000 B.C. to 100 B.C. Hence row 3 is correctly matched.\n• Salihundam in Andhra Pradesh, India is known for its shrines dating back to the Buddhist era. The complex consists of monuments like mahastupas (large stupas), chaityas (prayer halls), viharas (monasteries), mandapas (pavilion halls), and votive stupas (smaller stupas).

India is a member of the International Grains Council (IGC). Hence statement 1 is correct.\n- Being a member of the International Grains Council is not a requirement for a country to export or import rice and wheat. The IGC operates through a system of member states, currently comprising major grainproducing and consuming countries. These members collaborate through regular meetings and consultations, where they discuss market conditions, policy challenges, and potential areas for collective action. Hence statement 2 is not correct.\nHence option (a) is the correct answer.",

Roughly 2.7 million people have been displaced and 1.6 million children are malnourished. Multiple military coups have occurred in the region since 2020: two each in Burkina Faso and Mali, one in Chad, and another in neighbouring Guinea. Hence statement 2 is correct.

Thickness of the troposphere is greatest at the equator because heat is transported to great heights by strong convectional currents. Hence option (a) is the correct answer. This layer contains dust particles and water vapour. All changes in climate and weather take place in this layer. The temperature in this layer decreases at the rate of $1^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ for every 165 m of height. This is the most important layer for all biological activity. The zone separating the troposphere from stratosphere is known as the tropopause. The air temperature at the tropopause is about minus $80^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ over the equator and",

      "explanation": "Cocoa, a native to the Americas, was a valuable crop in the earliest South American cultures. The term cocoa originated from the Nahuatl word \"cacahuatl\". Many believe that the plant first grew in the Amazon and upper Orinoco basins but the Mayans and the Aztecs eventually developed techniques to cultivate cocoa successfully. The plant was considered as a symbol of wealth for these civilizations and its beans were used as currency. Cocoa beans are the main\ningredient for making chocolate.\nCocoa beans are produced in tropical zones around the Equator, where climate conditions are well suited for growing cocoa trees. About 70 percent of the world's cocoa beans come from four West African countries: Ivory Coast, Ghana, Nigeria and Cameroon. The Ivory Coast and Ghana are by far the two largest producers of cocoa, accounting for more than 50 percent of the world's cocoa. In 2021, the Ivory Coast alone produced approximately 2.1 million metric tons of cocoa beans. Hence option (c) is the correct answer.",

After collecting the waters of its tributaries - Tila, Seti and Beri, it comes out of the mountain, cutting a deep gorge at Shishapani. The river Sarda (Kali or Kali Ganga) joins it in the plain before it finally meets the Ganga at Chhapra.\nThe Gandak comprises two streams, namely Kaligandak and Trishulganga. It rises in the Nepal Himalayas\nbetween the Dhaulagiri and Mount Everest and drains the central part of Nepal. It enters the Ganga plain in Champaran district of Bihar and joins the Ganga at Sonpur near Patna.\nThe Kosi is an antecedent river with its source to the north of Mount Everest in Tibet, where its main stream Arun rises. After crossing the Central Himalayas in Nepal, it is joined by the Son Kosi from the West and the Tamur Kosi from the east. It forms Sapt Kosi after uniting with the river Arun.

It is the 34th highest waterfall in India. The Subarnarekha originates from the Ranchi Plateau in Jharkhand Forming the boundary between West Bengal and Odisha in its lower course. It joins the Bay of Bengal forming an estuary between the Ganga and Mahanadi deltas. Its total length is 395 km. Information given in row 3 is not correctly matched: Gersoppa waterfall is created by the Sharavathi River falling from a height of 253 m (830ft), making it the second-highest plunge waterfall in India. Located near Sagara, Shimoga District of Karnataka state. It is also called by alternative names of Gerusoppa falls, Gersoppa Falls and Jogada Gundi. The Sharavathi River basin is situated in the central part of the Western Ghats. It originates at Ambuthirtha and flows towards west for about 132 km before joining the Arabian Sea at Honnavar.",

      "explanation": "Cicadas are members of the superfamily Cicadoidea and are physically distinguished by their stout bodies, broad heads, clear-membraned wings, and large compound eyes. Several cultures regarded these insects as powerful symbols of rebirth due to their unusual life cycles. There are more than 3,000 species of cicadas, which fall into roughly two categories: annual cicadas, which are spotted every year, and periodical cicadas, which spend most of their lives underground and only emerge once every decade or two. The froghoppers, or the superfamily Cercopoidea, are a group of hemipteran insects in the suborder Auchenorrhyncha. Adults are capable of jumping many times their height and length, giving the group their common name, but many species are best known for their plant-sucking nymphs which produce foam shelters, and are referred to as \"spittlebugs\" Pond skaters are predatory bugs/insects that mainly go around picking off the dead and unfortunate animals that fall onto the water surface and are trapped there. Hence option (c) is the correct answer",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Statement I is correct: Modern chewing gum is made up of four groups of ingredients that give gum its distinction flavor, texture, and bounce: \n1. Fillers, such as talc and calcium carbonate, bulk out the gum and give it satisfying heft.\n2. Polymers give gum their stretch. These are polymers such as polyvinyl acetate, along with other materials that make up the 'gum base.'\n3. Emulsifiers are chemicals that help mix flavors and colors and reduce stickiness.\n4. Softeners, such as vegetable oil, are added to the gum base to keep it chewy rather than stiff.\nStatement II is correct: Regular chewing gum has a substance called PVA (polyvinyl acetate), which is used to make tyres and glue. The gums that we consume are plastic based, and PVA, in fact also damages public property. A Research Gate report states, 'Each year, chewing gum generates more than 105 tonnes of 'plastic' garbage. Thus, the discarded non-biodegradable residue of the gum produces plastic pollution.' This waste is hard to collect or track and ends up living and polluting the earth for thousands of years. Hence statement II is the correct explanation of statement I.",

Cheetahs produce a variety of sounds including growls, purrs that generally denote contentment, chirps (between a mother and her cubs), and an 'explosive yelp'.\nStatement 3 is not correct: Leopards are territorial and mark their territory with faeces, urine and cheek-rubbing on trees. They can also leave scrape markings on the ground, trees or logs. This communicates to other leopards passing through that the territory they are in is occupied.",

      "explanation": "In many species of fig trees, there is a tight one-to-one relationship with the pollinator species of wasp. It means that a given fig species can be pollinated only by its 'partner' wasp species and no other species. The wasp pollinates the fig inflorescence while looking for suitable egg-laying sites. In return for the favour of pollination, the fig offers the wasp some of its developing seeds as food for the developing wasp larvae. Hence option (a) is the correct answer.",

It is likewise found along coastal Chile in South America. The marine west coast climate extends further inland into northwest Europe than in North America due to the orientation of mountains. This climate is also found on the southeast coast of Australia and New Zealand.\nThe marine west coast is noted for its mild summers and winters and, as a result, a small annual temperature range. Its location on the west coast of a continent in the midlatitudes places the climate in the path of the Westerlies. In this situation, the climate receives a constant influx of oceanic air throughout the year. The mild temperatures are a direct result of the moderating influence of ocean bodies on air temperatures. The is especially true for those situations where a warm ocean current borders the continent, like the North Atlantic Drift's effect on northwestern Europe. Temperature ranges increase as one moves away from the coast.\nThe marine west coast climate is dominated by cyclonic activity embedded in the Westerlies. Frequent cyclonic storms bring prolonged periods of rain, drizzle and fog to these west coast locations. In some locations it is not uncommon to receive as much as 250 cm (100 in) of precipitation in a year. Hence option (d) is the correct answer.",

The deflection is more when the wind velocity is high. Hence statement 1 is correct.\nThe Coriolis force is directly proportional to the angle of latitude. It is maximum at the poles and is absent at the equator. Hence statement 2 is correct.\nThe Coriolis force acts perpendicular to the pressure gradient force. The pressure gradient force is perpendicular to an isobar. The higher the pressure gradient force, the more is the velocity of the wind and the larger is the deflection in the direction of wind. As a result of these two forces operating perpendicular to each other, in the low-pressure areas the wind blows around it.\nAt the equator, the Coriolis force is zero and the wind blows perpendicular to the isobars. The low pressure gets filled instead of getting intensified. That is the reason why tropical cyclones are not formed near the equator",

      "explanation": "The axis of the earth which is an imaginary line, makes an angle of $661 / 2^{\\circ}$ with its orbital plane. The plane formed by the orbit is known as the orbital plane. The earth receives light from the sun. Due to the spherical shape of the earth, only half of it gets light from the sun at a time. The portion facing the sun experiences day while the other half away from the sun experiences night.\nOn 21st June, the Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the sun. The rays of the sun fall directly on the Tropic of Cancer. As a result, these areas receive more heat. The areas near the poles receive less heat as the rays of the sun are slanting. The North Pole is inclined towards the sun and the places beyond the Arctic Circle experience continuous daylight for about six months. Since a large portion of the Northern Hemisphere is getting light from the sun, it is summer in the regions north of the equator. The longest day and the shortest night at these places occur on 21st June. At this time in the Southern Hemisphere all these conditions are reversed. It is winter season there. The nights are longer than the days. This position of the earth is called the Summer Solstice. Hence option (d) is the correct answer.",

In India, Stock Exchanges can offer separate trading platforms for debts.\nWhich of the statements given above is/are correct?",

Basically, LAF enables liquidity management on a day to day basis. The operations of LAF are conducted by way of repurchase agreements (repos and reverse repos) with RBI being the counterparty to all the transactions. All Scheduled Commercial Banks (excluding Regional Rural Banks) and Primary Dealers (PDs) having Current Account and SGL Account with RBI, Mumbai will be eligible to participate in the Repo and Reverse Repo auctions. Only some specified NBFCs form part of PDs and major NBFCs not part of PDs remain outside the preview of accessing LAF window of RBI. Hence statement 1 is not correct.\nFIIs who obtain specific approval from SEBI have been permitted to invest 100% of their portfolios in debt securities. Such investment may be in listed or to be listed corporate debt securities or in dated government securities, and is treated to be part of the overall limit on external commercial borrowing. Hence statement 2 is correct.\nWith an aim to develop corporate debt market in the country, Sebi allowed creation of a separate debt segment on stock exchanges, wherein banks are allowed to become trading members of the bourses and trade in this market. NSE became the first to unveil a separate trading platform for debts. Hence statement 3 is correct.",

Dairy farm Primary\n3. Mineral exploration Tertiary\n4. Weaving cloth Secondary\nHow many of the pairs given above are correctly matched?",
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Occupation wise an economy is broadly divided into primary, secondary and tertiary sectors. Primary sector includes production units producing goods by exploiting natural resources. Some examples are farming, mining, fishing, dairy farming etc. Most of such economic activities are usually carried out in rural areas. Hence pair 2 is correctly matched. The secondary sector covers activities in which natural products are changed into other forms through ways of manufacturing that we associate with industrial activity. Some examples are production of bicycles, scooters, spinning and weaving etc. Most of these activities are carried out in a factory or mill. Hence pair 4 is correctly matched. The tertiary sector includes units producing only services like banks, transport shops, insurance government department, domestic servants, etc. These are activities that help in the development of the primary and secondary sectors. These activities, by themselves, do not produce a good but they are an aid or a support for the production process. For example, goods that are produced in the primary or secondary sector would need to be transported by trucks or trains and then sold in wholesale and retail shops. At times, it may be necessary to store these in godowns. Transport, storage, communication, banking, trade are some examples of tertiary activities. Hence pair 1 is not correctly matched. Further, Mineral exploration (different from mining) is a complex activity representing high end research and development for exploration of minerals. It also involves specialists and consultants for prospecting of minerals skill and knowledge based economy. Though activities involving R&D, specialists and consulting form part of Quaternary and Quinary sector, it has been historically been covered under Tertiary sector. So, in context of 3 major sectors of Indian economy (Primary, Secondary, tertiary), we can say that mineral exploration should form part of Tertiary sector per se. Hence pair 3 is correctly matched.",

Farmer's plough and computer are classified as fixed capital because they are long term assets that provide benefit over multiple production cycles. Hence pair 1 is not correctly matched and pair 2 is correctly matched. Conversely, working capital addresses the short-term financial needs essential for day-to-day operational activities. Both petrol and yarn are raw materials consumed within a single production cycle and are essential for the day to day operations of their respective businesses.

Thus, options (a), (c) and (d) are incorrect. Statement 2 is correct as its use in the spacecrafts has been its primary applications. NASA has been using the technology since the 1960s.\nStatement 3 is correct: Pu-238 is used due to its low half-life.",

      "explanation": "Radar, electromagnetic sensor used for detecting, locating, tracking, and recognizing objects of various kinds at considerable distances. It operates by transmitting electromagnetic energy toward objects, commonly referred to as targets, and observing the echoes returned from them.\nOption 1 is not correct: At the airports scanners use Xray machines and metal detectors and not radar-based detectors (which use long-wave radiations; radiowaves) are generally used. At the same time, millimetre wave radar applications have also been used for airport surface movement control and foreign object detection, but the same cannot be called conventional radar. Thus option 1 is not correct.\nOption 2 is correct: Weather radars can be used to monitor the weather of a particular place.\nOption 3 is correct: Using radar has allowed researchers to examine migration altitude, speed, and wing beat frequency of birds, bats, and even insects during migration.",
