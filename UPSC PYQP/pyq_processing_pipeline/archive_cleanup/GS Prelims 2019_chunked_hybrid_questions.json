Under LTE, the infrastructure of telecom players only allows transmission of data while voice calls are routed to their older 2G or 3G networks. This is why, under LTE, you cannot access your 4G data services while on a call. This leads to problems such as slow internet speeds and poor voice clarity. VoLTE allows voice calls to be 'packaged' and carried through LTE networks. This would mean 4G data accessibility even during calls. Hence, statement 2 is not correct.

It obliges the States to prevent and criminalize different corrupt practices, promote international cooperation, cooperate for the recovery of stolen assets and enhance technical assistance and information exchange.\nStatement 3 is not correct: The UNTOC was adopted by General Assembly in 2000 and came into force in 2003. The Convention is the first comprehensive and global legally binding instrument to fight transnational organized crime. States that have ratified UNTOC commit themselves to taking a series of measures to prevent and control transnational organized crime, including (i) the criminalising of the participation in an organized criminal group, of money laundering, related corruption and obstruction of justice and (ii) the adoption of frameworks for extradition, mutual legal assistance and international cooperation. The UNTOC is further supplemented by three Protocols, which target specific forms of organized crime:\n1) The Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, provides an agreed upon definition of trafficking in persons. It aims at comprehensively addressing trafficking in persons through the so-called three P's -Prosecution of perpetrators, Protection of victims and Prevention of trafficking.\n2) The Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air, also provides a definition of smuggling of migrants. The Protocol aims at preventing and controlling smuggling of migrants, promoting cooperation among States Parties, while protecting the rights of smuggled migrants.\n3) The Protocol against the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms, their Parts and Components and Ammunition promotes, facilitates and strengthens cooperation among States Parties in order to prevent and control the illicit manufacturing of and trafficking in firearms, their parts and components and ammunition by mainly committing Member States to introduce solid registration and storage systems for all legally produced arms.\nStatement 4 is correct: The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) is mandated by its Member States to assist in the implementation of both Conventions.",

In India, antibiotic FDCs are heavily prescribed even without the knowledge of a proven advantage over single compounds. Injudicious use of antibiotic FDCs could lead to emergence of bacterial strains resistant to multiple antibiotics. (However, the per capita consumption of antibiotics in India is much lower than in several other high-income countries).

The second agency of judiciary was the Qazi. Qazi had a bigger role in the judiciary system in the state and he held the court and gave justice. Whereas Jagirdars were those mansabbars who were given salary in lieu of military service in terms of jagirs(land). \nHence statement 1 is not correct. The judicial and police functions were performed locally by zamindars. \n- An important feature of the jagir system was shifting of jagir-holders from one jagir to another for administrative reasons. This system of transfers checked the jagirdars from developing local roots. Thus jagirs were transferable and could be seized too. Zamindars on the other hand were hereditary. The zamindars were present in practically every part of the Mughal Empire and held the most significant position in the agrarian structure of Mughal India. Hence statement 2 is not correct.",

In the wild, they can live up to 80 years and grow up to five feet long. Once mature, it is the only sea turtle that is strictly herbivorous.\n- Statement 2 is correct: Parrotfish are algae eaters. They obtain the algae by ripping small chunks of coral from a reef. Many other herbivores thrive among the fish population. Other herbivores include the Japanese angelfish, yellow bloth rabbitfish, and tilapia.\n- Statement 3 is correct: The diet of Manatees consists of water grasses, weeds, and algae. Dugongs are related to manatees, which are both endangered and protected animals. These slow-moving herbivores graze on underwater grasses, rooting them out with bristled, sensitive snouts and chomping them with rough lips.\n- Statement 4 is correct: Snakes that are viviparous nourish their developing young through a placenta and yolk sac, something that is highly unusual among reptiles. Boa constrictors and green anacondas are two examples of viviparous snakes, meaning they give birth to live young with no eggs involved at any stage of development.",

In order to consolidate, the Turkish rulers made revenue assignments (iqta), in lieu of cash, to their nobles. So, Iqtas were provinces or spheres of influence which were put under the charge of officers called 'Iqtadars' (governors). Iqta is an Arabic word and the institution had been in force in the early Islamic world as a form of reward for services to the state. It was used in the Caliphate administration as a way of financing operations and paying civil and military officers. It was not an ancient indigenous institution. Hence statement 2 is not correct.\n- In Akbar's administration, the military department was headed by Mir Bakshi which looked after all matters pertaining to the military administration.

Each leaf measured about $27^{\\prime \\prime} \\times 20^{\\prime \\prime}$. The style of Hamzanama is more developed and refined than that of the Tutinama.\n- Under Jahangir, painting acquired greater charm, refinement and dignity.

The main advantage of the use of H-CNG is the elimination of carbon monoxide emissions.\n2. H-CNG as fuel reduces carbon dioxide and hydrocarbon emissions.\n3. Hydrogen up to one-fifth by volume can be blended with CNG as fuel for buses.\n4.

      "explanation": "- Statement 1 is not correct and statements 2 and 3 are correct: H-CNG is a blend of hydrogen and CNG, the ideal hydrogen concentration being $18 \\%$. Compared to conventional CNG, use of HCNG can reduce emission of carbon monoxide up to $70 \\%$ and 15\\% reduction in total hydro carbon emissions, besides enabling up to 5\\% savings in fuel.\n- Statement 4 is not correct: In its report to the Supreme Court, the EPCA has estimated that to fuel Delhi's 5,500 buses, about 400 tonnes H-CNG would be needed per day. Setting up four fuel-dispensing facilities would cost Rs 330 crore, which can be funded from the Environment Compensation Charge (ECC) fund made up of cess on commercial vehicles entering Delhi, it said. For consumers who pay Rs 42 per kg for CNG, the cost of H-CNG would not be more than Rs 43 per kg.",

On account of these reasons, the Central Government took a decision to nationalise the private coal mines.

Near-infrared radiation is being used to detect healthy vegetation in agriculture. Healthy vegetation reflects green light and absorbs red and blue light. The green light that our eyes see is chlorophyll created by plants during photosynthesis. Chlorophyll will reflect more light in the green and near infrared spectrum compared to other wavelengths.

Owing to melting of ice, global warming might trigger the release of methane gas from these deposits.\n- Statement 2 is correct: Four Earth environments have the temperature and pressure conditions suitable for the formation and stability of methane hydrate. These are: 1) sediment and sedimentary rock units below Arctic permafrost; 2) sedimentary deposits along continental margins; 3) deep-water sediments of inland lakes and seas; and, 4) under Antarctic ice.\n- Statement 3 is correct: Methane is relatively short-lived in the atmosphere; a molecule of methane is oxidized to water and carbon dioxide after a decade or so, mainly by reaction with another trace gas, the hydroxyl radical OH-.
