These orders come into force on a date to be specified by the President of India in this behalf. The copies of its orders are laid before the House of the People and the State Legislative Assembly concerned, but no modifications are permissible therein by them.",

Hence pair 2 is not correctly matched.\nThe Congress for Democracy (CFD) was an Indian political party founded in 1977 by Jagjivan Ram. It was formed after Jagjivan Ram, Hemavati Nandan Bahuguna, and Nandini Satpathy left the Indian National Congress of Indira Gandhi and denounced her rule during the Indian Emergency. Hence pair 3 is correctly matched.\nThe Swatantra Party was an Indian classical liberal political party that existed from 1959 to 1974. It was founded by C.

      "explanation": "The Ethics Committee of the Lok Sabha and its History:\nThe genesis of the formation of the Ethics Committee in Parliament can be traced to a resolution adopted at the Presiding Officers Conference held in New Delhi in October 1996 which desired the legislatures to explore the possibility of constituting an Ethics Committee. It is in pursuance of this resolution that the endeavour for setting up of the Ethics Committee in Indian Legislatures began in earnest.\nThen Vice President (and Rajya Sabha Chairman) K R Narayanan constituted the Ethics Committee of the Upper House on March 4, 1997, and it was inaugurated that May to oversee the moral and ethical conduct of members and examine cases of misconduct referred to it. The Rules applicable to the Committee of Privileges also apply to the ethics panel.\nIn the case of Lok Sabha, a study group of the House Committee of Privileges, after visiting Australia, the UK, and the US in 1997 to look into practices pertaining to the conduct and ethics of legislators, recommended the constitution of an Ethics Committee, but it could not be taken up by Lok Sabha. The Committee of Privileges finally recommended the constitution of an Ethics Committee during the 13th Lok Sabha. The late Speaker, G M C Balayogi, constituted an ad hoc Ethics Committee in 2000, which became a permanent part of the House only in 2015. Hence, statement 1 is correct.\nAny person can complain against a Member through another Lok Sabha MP, along with evidence of the alleged misconduct, and an affidavit stating that the complaint is not \"false, frivolous, or vexatious\". If the Member himself complains, the affidavit is not needed. The Speaker can refer to the Committee any complaint against an MP. Hence, statement 2 is not correct.\nThe Committee does not entertain complaints based only on media reports or on matters that are sub judice. The Committee makes a prima facie inquiry before deciding to examine a complaint. It makes its recommendations after evaluating the complaint. Hence, statement 3 is correct.",

Defence, External Affairs, Ecclesiastical Affairs, and the administration of Tribal Areas were reserved in the hands of the Governor-General.\nBicameral Legislature: The Act established a bicameral federal legislature consisting of the Council of State and the Federal Assembly.\nExtension of Franchise: The Act extended the franchise, increasing the size of the legislatures.\nEstablishment of a Federal Court: The Act provided for the establishment of a Federal Court.\nSafeguards for Minorities: The Act included provisions safeguarding the rights of minorities.",

There is no consensus regarding when the play was written, and it has been dated variously from 475 BCE to the 11th century CE. The Sanskrit poet Nannaya, who lived around 400 CE , has mentioned Bhasa in his works, and this suggests Bhasa may have lived around 350 CE. Bhasa was an ancient Indian playwright who is considered one of the earliest known dramatists in Sanskrit literature. He was the author of works such as the Madhyamavyayoga, DutaGhatotkacha, Dutavakya, Balacharita and Charudatta.",

Nigeria will become the world's second most populous country, with 791 million people. The new study predicts that Nigeria will have one of the largest working-age populations in the world by 2100 and see big increases in GDP. - South Korea's demographic crisis has become the top risk to economic growth and the social welfare system, with the country's population of 51 million on track to halve by the end of this century.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "As the national debt has soared, the U.S. Treasury Department has had to borrow more money to pay for government spending by revoking the Debt ceiling. The debt ceiling sets the maximum amount of outstanding federal debt the U.S. government can incur.\nRaising or suspending the debt ceiling by US Congress becomes necessary when the government needs to borrow more money to pay its debts than is federally authorized. If Congress fails to lift the debt ceiling before the due date when the Treasury will run out of cash—the federal government will not be able to pay its obligations. Further, if United States of America (USA) were to default on its debt, holders of US Treasury Bonds will not be able to exercise their claims to receive payment. Hence statement-I is correct.\nFurther, the Currencies like US dollars are fiat currency. Fiat money is a government-issued currency that is not backed by a physical commodity, such as gold or silver, but rather by the government that issued it. The value of fiat money is derived from the relationship between supply and demand and the stability of the issuing government, rather than the worth of a commodity backing it. Furthermore, if people lose faith in a nation's currency, the money will no longer hold value. So, Treasury Bonds issued by US government are not backed by any hard assets but based on only faith of the government and if government fails to repay the debt taken, then bond holders would not have right to exercise their claims to receive payment. Hence statement-II is correct and it is the correct explanation of statement-I.",

Shriram Finance raised multi-currency loan of $468 million via ECB in January, 2024. This is the largest widely syndicated loan transaction for a private NBFC from India in recent years. A syndicated loan is a form of financing that is offered by a group of lenders. Syndicated loans arise when a project requires too large a loan for a single lender or when a project needs a specialized lender with expertise in a specific asset class. Syndicating allows lenders to spread risk and take part in financial opportunities that may be too large for their individual capital base. Syndicated loans involve large sums, which allows the risk to be spread out among several financial institutions to mitigate the risk in case the borrower defaults. Lenders are referred to as a syndicate, which works together to provide funds for a single borrower. Hence statement-I is correct. The borrower can be a corporation, a large project, or a sovereign government. The loan can involve a fixed amount of funds, a credit line, or a combination of the two.

While money in digital form is predominant in India-for example in bank accounts recorded as book entries on commercial bank ledgers-a CBDC would differ from existing digital money available to the public because a CBDC would be a liability of the Reserve Bank, and not of a commercial bank.\nThe features of CBDC include:\n- CBDC is sovereign currency issued by Central Banks in alignment with their monetary policy. Hence statement 1 is correct.\n- It appears as a liability on the central bank's balance sheet. Hence statement 2 is correct.\n- Must be accepted as a medium of payment, legal tender, and a safe store of value by all citizens, enterprises, and government agencies.\n- Freely convertible against commercial bank money and cash.

      "explanation": "LAF is a facility extended by RBI to the scheduled commercial banks (excluding RRBs) and Primary Dealers (PDs) to avail of liquidity in case of requirement or park excess funds with RBI in case of excess liquidity on an overnight basis against the collateral of G-Secs including SDLs. Basically, LAF enables liquidity management on a day to day basis. The operations of LAF are conducted by way of repurchase agreements (repos and reverse repos) with RBI being the counterparty to all the transactions. All Scheduled Commercial Banks (excluding Regional Rural Banks) and Primary Dealers (PDs) having Current Account and SGL Account with RBI, Mumbai will be eligible to participate in the Repo and Reverse Repo auctions. Only some specified NBFCs form part of PDs and major NBFCs not part of PDs remain outside the preview of accessing LAF window of RBI. Hence statement 1 is not correct.\nFIIs who obtain specific approval from SEBI have been permitted to invest 100% of their portfolios in debt securities. Such investment may be in listed or to be listed corporate debt securities or in dated government securities, and is treated to be part of the overall limit on external commercial borrowing. Hence statement 2 is correct.\nWith an aim to develop corporate debt market in the country, Sebi allowed creation of a separate debt segment on stock exchanges, wherein banks are allowed to become trading members of the bourses and trade in this market. NSE became the first to unveil a separate trading platform for debts. Hence statement 3 is correct.",

      "explanation": "A Government Security (G-Sec) is a tradeable instrument issued by the Central Government or the State Governments. It acknowledges the Government's debt obligation. Such securities are short term (usually called treasury bills, with original maturities of less than one year) or long term (usually called Government bonds or dated securities with original maturity of one year or more).\nMajor players in the G-Secs and Corporate Bond market include commercial banks and PDs besides institutional investors like insurance companies. PDs play an important role as market makers in G-Secs market. A market maker provides firm two way quotes in the market i.e. both buy and sell executable quotes for the concerned securities. Other participants include cooperative banks, regional rural banks, mutual funds, provident and pension funds.\nThrough the Retail Direct scheme, individual investors can invest in Government bonds. In this scheme, individuals must register with the RBI for a Gilt Securities Account, called RDG or Retail Direct Gilt. RDG account holders can partake in the primary issuance of SG/CG/SGB/T-bill.

Massive stars also use up the hydrogen fuel in their core faster, despite starting out with much more of it, meaning they live much shorter lives than dwarf stars. A giant star will also end its life in a spectacular fashion, via a supernova explosion, leaving behind a strange object such as a neutron star or an even more bizarre black hole.\nStatement I is not correct and statement 2 is correct: Giant stars are short-lived due to the faster rates of nuclear reactions.

      "explanation": "Fifth generation fighters are the most technologically advanced jets ever built. They were designed to operate with the help of digital programs and fly-by-wire to counter the threats they counter on the battlefield. Sophisticated avionics, stealth technology and super maneuverability are just a few advantages over older jets that gives them domination in the sky. Being invisible to the enemies is a priority for the engineers, but it is also an extremely hard task for them. The stealth technology is a complex and advanced range of techniques which makes the aircraft (or any other vehicle) less visible to the opponent's radars, and therefore reduces the chance of being detected.\nOption 1 is not correct: Rafael is often dubbed 4+ or 4.5 .\nOption 2 is not correct: The Mikoyan MiG-29 (NATO reporting name: Fulcrum) is a 4th-generation jet fighter aircraft designed in the Soviet Union for an air superiority role.\nOption 3 is not correct: The Tejas Mark-1A is an indigenously designed, developed and manufactured modern 4-plus generation fighter aircraft with more than 65 per cent indigenous components.",

      "explanation": "Hydrogels have been in the news for their diverse applications. Recently, hydrogels were in the news for their application in developing glucose-measuring technique in smartphones.\nHydrogels are cross-linked polymeric networks swollen in biological fluid. They are widely used in the field of medicine. However, their uses are varied.\nThis class of materials is used for local drug delivery because they provide high biocompatibility, drug protection, spatiotemporal control of the drug release, and physicochemical tailorability.\nOption 1 is correct: Hydrophilic polymeric networks that are capable of imbibing huge volumes of water and undergoing swelling and shrinkage suitably to facilitate controlled drug-release are called hydrogels. Their porosity and compatibility with aqueous environments make them highly attractive bio-compatible drug delivery vehicles.\nOption 2 is correct: Due to its water-absorbing properties hydrogels may be used to cool down electronic items.\nOption 3 is correct: Researches show hydrogels can be used as lubricants because of their excellent antifriction and anti-wear properties.",
