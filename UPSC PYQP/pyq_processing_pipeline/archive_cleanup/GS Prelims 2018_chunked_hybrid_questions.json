      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Membership of the NSG means: 1. Access to technology for a range of uses from medicine to building nuclear power plants for India from the NSG which is essentially a traders' cartel. India has its own indigenously developed technology but to get its hands on state of the art technology that countries within the NSG possess, it has to become part of the group. Hence statement 1 is correct. 2. With India committed to reducing dependence on fossil fuels and ensuring that 40% of its energy is sourced from renewable and clean sources, there is a pressing need to scale up nuclear power production. This can only happen if India gains access to the NSG. Even if India today can buy power plants from the global market thanks to the one time NSG waiver in 2008, there are still many types of technologies India can be denied as it is outside the NSG. 3. India could sign the Nuclear non proliferation treaty and gain access to all this know how but that would mean giving up its entire nuclear arsenal. Given that it is situated in an unstable and unpredictable neighborhood India is unlikely to sign the NPT or accede to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) that puts curbs on any further nuclear tests. 4. With access to latest technology, India can commercialize the production of nuclear power equipment. This, in turn will boost innovation and high tech manufacturing in India",

Shivaji were published in 1896 and those of Dayanand and. Shri Krishna in 1898.

He had seen the points of similarity between the problems of India and those the Italian leaders had to face. Lala Lajpat Rai travelled to the US in 1907. He toured Sikh communities along the West Coast in the USA and noted sociological similarities between the notion of 'color-caste' there and within castes in India. He joined Swaraj Party in 1926 and was elected its Deputy Leader in the Central Legislative Assembly. He later resigned from the Swaraj Party in August 1926.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Buland Darwaza at Fatehpur Sikri is the most iconic architectural accomplishment of Akbar's reign. It incorporates almost all the essential features of Akbar's architectural traditions: red sandstone, stone carvings, relief by inserting white marble, etc. This monumental gate, however, was probably less intended to commemorate a military victory than to underscore Akbar's links with the Chishti order. Its surface is covered by marble slabs inscribed with Quranic verses promising paradise to true believers, appropriate for the entrance into a khanqah, a complex intended for meditation and devotion. Asafilmambara, or Bara Imambara, of Lucknow was built to give employment and revenue to the public. Resources were strained, a peak had been reached in architectural style, and a certain decadence had crept in. To overcome these, the Nawabs used a more economical style in architecture, which also gave a touch of lightness to the buildings.\nInstead of stones and marble, brick and lime were used. Stucco ornamentation (gajkari) was used to decorate the monuments, giving it a deep relief effect even on flat walls.\nMother of pearl and shells deposited in lake beds were used in the stucco ornamentation to give a shine finer than marble.\nThe local masons cleverly used the brick, with its small size and thickness, to form remarkably fine details on the wall and column surfaces. It's a testimony to their skill that they could adapt lowly material to such wonderful effect: balusters were imitated in clay supported on",

      "explanation": "The universe of the Great Vehicle contains numerous Bodhisattvas, chief of whom, from the earthly point of view, is Avalokiteshwar (\"The Lord who Looks Down\"), also called Padmapani (\"The Lotus-Bearer\") also called Lokesvara in Sanskrit ( The Lord of the World). His special attribute is compassion, and his helping hand reaches even to Avici, the deepest and most unpleasant of the Buddhist purgatories. Another important Bodhisattva is Manjusri, whose special activity is to stimulate the understanding, and who is depicted with a naked sword in one hand, to destroy error and falsehood, and a book in the other, describing the ten paramilas, or great spiritual perfections, which are the cardinal virtues developed by Bodhisattvas. Vajrapani, a sterner Bodhi-sattva, is the foe of sin and evil, and, like the god Indra, bears a thunderbolt in his hand. The gentle Maitreya, the future Buddha, is worshipped as a Bodhisattva. Also worthy of mention is Ksitigarbha, the guardian of the purgatories, who is thought of not as a fierce torturer, but rather as the governor of a model prison, doing his best to make life tolerable for his charges, and helping them to earn remission of sentence.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The Company forced the states into a \"subsidiary alliance\". According to the terms of this alliance, Indian rulers were not allowed to have their independent armed forces. They were to be protected by the Company, but had to pay for the \"subsidiary forces\" that the Company was supposed to maintain for the purpose of this protection. If the Indian rulers failed to make the payment, then part of their territory was taken away as penalty. During this phase, from 1813 to 1857, the British made almost all the Indian States subordinate to their power, by compelling them to enter into subsidiary alliances with them. The Indian Princes were put under obligation to accept the British Paramountcy.\nNapoleonic invasion of Egypt in the summer of 1798 offered Wellesley a useful tool to soften London's resistance to expansion, although he never believed for a moment that there was any danger of a French invasion of British India either over land from Egypt or a naval attack round the Cape of Good Hope. However, to assuage London's concerns he evolved the policy of 'Subsidiary Alliance', which would only establish control over the internal affairs of an Indian state, without incurring any direct imperial liability.\nThere was no component of fixed income under this system.",
      "motivation": "Policy of Subsidiary Alliance introduced with the chief aim to expand the British empire in India. While the practice of helping an Indian ruler with a paid British force was quite old, it was given definite shape by Welleseley who used it to sub-ordinate the Indian states to the paramount authority of the company.",

Depletion of sand in the streambed and along coastal areas causes the deepening of rivers and estuaries, and the enlargement of river mouths and coastal inlets. It may also lead to saline-water intrusion from the nearby sea. The effect of mining is compounded by the effect of sea level rise. Any volume of sand exported from streambeds and coastal areas is a loss to the system. Excessive instream sand mining is a threat to bridges, river banks and nearby structures. Sand mining also affects the adjoining groundwater system and the uses that local people make of the river. Sand aquifer helps in recharging the water table and sand mining causes sinking of water tables in the nearby areas, drops leaving the drinking water wells on the embankments of these rivers dry.

      "explanation": "Organic matter affects both the chemical and physical properties of the soil and its overall health. Properties influenced by organic matter include: soil structure; moisture holding capacity; diversity and activity of soil organisms, both those that are beneficial and harmful to crop production; and nutrient availability. Increased levels of organic matter and associated soil fauna lead to greater pore space with the immediate result that water infiltrates more readily and can be held in the soil. The improved pore space is a consequence of the bioturbating activities of earthworms and other macro-organisms and channels left in the soil by decayed plant roots. Sulfur is one of three nutrients that are cycled between the soil, plant matter and the atmosphere. The sulfur cycle describes the movement of sulfur through the atmosphere, mineral and organic forms, and through living things. Although sulfur is primarily found in sedimentary rocks, it is particularly important to living things because it is a component of many proteins. Sulfur is released by weathering of rocks and minerals. Water, temperature and chemical reactions break down minerals releasing their component elements. Once sulfur is exposed",
