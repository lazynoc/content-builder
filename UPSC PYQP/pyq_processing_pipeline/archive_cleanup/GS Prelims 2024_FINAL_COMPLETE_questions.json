      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Delimitation literally means the act or process of fixing limits or boundaries of territorial constituencies in a country or a province having a legislative body. The job of delimitation is assigned to a high power body. Such a body is known as Delimitation Commission or a Boundary Commission. In India, such Delimitation Commissions have been constituted 4 times - in 1952 under the Delimitation Commission Act, 1952, in 1963 under Delimitation Commission Act, 1962, in 1973 under Delimitation Act, 1972 and in 2002 under Delimitation Act, 2002. Hence, option (d) is the correct answer. The Delimitation Commission in India is a high power body whose orders have the force of law and cannot be called in question before any court. These orders come into force on a date to be specified by the President of India in this behalf. The copies of its orders are laid before the House of the People and the State Legislative Assembly concerned, but no modifications are permissible therein by them.",

Congress for Democracy Jagjivan Ram 4. Swatantra Party Acharya Narendra Dev How many of the above are correctly matched? (a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four",
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The Bharatiya Jana Sangh was an Indian nationalist political party. This party was established on 21 October 1951 in Delhi, that existed from 1951 to 1977. Its three founding members were Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, Balraj Madhok and Deendayal Upadhyaya. Hence pair 1 is correctly matched. C. Rajagopalachari was the founder of the Swatantra Party, not the Socialist Party. The Socialist Party was associated with leaders like Ram Manohar Lohia and Jayaprakash Narayan. Hence pair 2 is not correctly matched. The Congress for Democracy (CFD) was an Indian political party founded in 1977 by Jagjivan Ram. It was formed after Jagjivan Ram, Hemavati Nandan Bahuguna, and Nandini Satpathy left the Indian National Congress of Indira Gandhi and denounced her rule during the Indian Emergency. Hence pair 3 is correctly matched. The Swatantra Party was an Indian classical liberal political party that existed from 1959 to 1974. It was founded by C. Rajagopalachari in reaction to what he felt was the Jawaharlal Nehru-dominated Indian National Congress's increasingly socialist and statist outlook. Hence pair 4 is not correctly matched. Hence option (b) is the correct answer.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Under Article 85(2) of the Constitution, the President may from time to time prorogue Houses or either House of Parliament. Such prorogation requires the advice of the council of ministers. Hence, statement 1 is not correct.\nTermination of a session of the House by an Order by the President under the above constitutional provision is called 'prorogation'. Prorogation normally follows the adjournment of the sitting of the House sine die. But the president can prorogue when the house is in session too. Hence, statement 2 is correct.\nDissolution of the Lok Sabha is done by the President of India who, save in exceptional circumstances, does so on the advice of the Council of Ministers. The President may on his discretion, look for alternate government formation if the present government cannot prove a majority. Hence, statement 3 is correct.",

However, the federation never materialized due to a lack of support from the required number of princely states.\nDivision of Powers: The Act divided powers between the center and the provinces into three lists - Federal, Provincial, and Concurrent.\nProvincial Autonomy: The Act abolished the diarchy system introduced by the Government of India Act of 1919 and granted a large measure of autonomy to the provinces.\nIntroduction of Dyarchy at the Center: The Act introduced the concept of dyarchy at the center.

Like Japan, Italy is known for its ageing population. More than $23 \\%$ of people there were over the age of 65 in 2019, according to World Bank data. - Nigeria and other countries in Africa are bucking the trend of population decline. Nigeria will become the world's second most populous country, with 791 million people. The new study predicts that Nigeria will have one of the largest working-age populations in the world by 2100 and see big increases in GDP. - South Korea's demographic crisis has become the top risk to economic growth and the social welfare system, with the country's population of 51 million on track to halve by the end of this century.

Hence pair 2 is correctly matched.\n- No, Turkey has not Rescinded its membership of NATO. But some countries think turkey can be a Trojan horse for NATO and block consensus on every decision until NATO members meet his price. Turkey today is a liability.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "As the national debt has soared, the U.S. Treasury Department has had to borrow more money to pay for government spending by revoking the Debt ceiling. The debt ceiling sets the maximum amount of outstanding federal debt the U.S. government can incur.\nRaising or suspending the debt ceiling by US Congress becomes necessary when the government needs to borrow more money to pay its debts than is federally authorized. If Congress fails to lift the debt ceiling before the due date when the Treasury will run out of cash—the federal government will not be able to pay its obligations. Further, if United States of America (USA) were to default on its debt, holders of US Treasury Bonds will not be able to exercise their claims to receive payment. Hence statement-I is correct.\nFurther, the Currencies like US dollars are fiat currency. Fiat money is a government-issued currency that is not backed by a physical commodity, such as gold or silver, but rather by the government that issued it. The value of fiat money is derived from the relationship between supply and demand and the stability of the issuing government, rather than the worth of a commodity backing it. Furthermore, if people lose faith in a nation's currency, the money will no longer hold value. So, Treasury Bonds issued by US government are not backed by any hard assets but based on only faith of the government and if government fails to repay the debt taken, then bond holders would not have right to exercise their claims to receive payment. Hence statement-II is correct and it is the correct explanation of statement-I.",

The plant was considered as a symbol of wealth for these civilizations and its beans were used as currency. Cocoa beans are the main\ningredient for making chocolate.\nCocoa beans are produced in tropical zones around the Equator, where climate conditions are well suited for growing cocoa trees. About 70 percent of the world's cocoa beans come from four West African countries: Ivory Coast, Ghana, Nigeria and Cameroon.

After flowing through an incised valley southwards through the districts of Sitapur, Lucknow, Barabanki, Sultanpur, and Jaunpur, it joins River Ganga near Varanasi.\nThe Ghaghara originates in the glaciers of Mapchachungo. After collecting the waters of its tributaries - Tila, Seti and Beri, it comes out of the mountain, cutting a deep gorge at Shishapani. The river Sarda (Kali or Kali Ganga) joins it in the plain before it finally meets the Ganga at Chhapra.\nThe Gandak comprises two streams, namely Kaligandak and Trishulganga. It rises in the Nepal Himalayas\nbetween the Dhaulagiri and Mount Everest and drains the central part of Nepal. It enters the Ganga plain in Champaran district of Bihar and joins the Ganga at Sonpur near Patna.\nThe Kosi is an antecedent river with its source to the north of Mount Everest in Tibet, where its main stream Arun rises. After crossing the Central Himalayas in Nepal, it is joined by the Son Kosi from the West and the Tamur Kosi from the east. It forms Sapt Kosi after uniting with the river Arun. The Kosi river joins Ganga in the Katihar district of Bihar. Hence option (b) is the correct answer.",

      "explanation": "Chemical weathering is the basic process by which denudation proceeds. It is the extremely slow and gradual decomposition of rocks due to exposure to air and water. Air and water contain chemical elements, which though they may be in small quantities, are sufficient to set up chemical reactions in the surface layers of exposed rocks. Such reactions may weaken or entirely dissolve certain constituents of the rock, thus loosening the other crystals and weakening the whole surface. There are three major chemical weathering processes: 1. Solution: Many minerals are dissolved by water,",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Cicadas are members of the superfamily Cicadoidea and are physically distinguished by their stout bodies, broad heads, clear-membraned wings, and large compound eyes. Several cultures regarded these insects as powerful symbols of rebirth due to their unusual life cycles. There are more than 3,000 species of cicadas, which fall into roughly two categories: annual cicadas, which are spotted every year, and periodical cicadas, which spend most of their lives underground and only emerge once every decade or two. The froghoppers, or the superfamily Cercopoidea, are a group of hemipteran insects in the suborder Auchenorrhyncha. Adults are capable of jumping many times their height and length, giving the group their common name, but many species are best known for their plant-sucking nymphs which produce foam shelters, and are referred to as \"spittlebugs\" Pond skaters are predatory bugs/insects that mainly go around picking off the dead and unfortunate animals that fall onto the water surface and are trapped there. Hence option (c) is the correct answer",

Fillers, such as talc and calcium carbonate, bulk out the gum and give it satisfying heft.\n2. Polymers give gum their stretch. These are polymers such as polyvinyl acetate, along with other materials that make up the 'gum base.'\n3. Emulsifiers are chemicals that help mix flavors and colors and reduce stickiness.\n4. Softeners, such as vegetable oil, are added to the gum base to keep it chewy rather than stiff.\nStatement II is correct: Regular chewing gum has a substance called PVA (polyvinyl acetate), which is used to make tyres and glue. The gums that we consume are plastic based, and PVA, in fact also damages public property. A Research Gate report states, 'Each year, chewing gum generates more than 105 tonnes of 'plastic' garbage. Thus, the discarded non-biodegradable residue of the gum produces plastic pollution.' This waste is hard to collect or track and ends up living and polluting the earth for thousands of years.

Precipitation varies between $50 \\mathrm{~cm}-250$ cm .\nWhat is this type of climate?\n(a) Equatorial climate\n(b) China type climate\n(c) Humid subtropical climate\n(d) Marine West coast climate",
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The marine west coast climate (British type) is found along a relatively narrow strip of coastal Oregon, Washington, British Columbia, and southern Alaska in North America. It is likewise found along coastal Chile in South America. The marine west coast climate extends further inland into northwest Europe than in North America due to the orientation of mountains. This climate is also found on the southeast coast of Australia and New Zealand.\nThe marine west coast is noted for its mild summers and winters and, as a result, a small annual temperature range. Its location on the west coast of a continent in the midlatitudes places the climate in the path of the Westerlies. In this situation, the climate receives a constant influx of oceanic air throughout the year. The mild temperatures are a direct result of the moderating influence of ocean bodies on air temperatures. The is especially true for those situations where a warm ocean current borders the continent, like the North Atlantic Drift's effect on northwestern Europe. Temperature ranges increase as one moves away from the coast.\nThe marine west coast climate is dominated by cyclonic activity embedded in the Westerlies. Frequent cyclonic storms bring prolonged periods of rain, drizzle and fog to these west coast locations. In some locations it is not uncommon to receive as much as 250 cm (100 in) of precipitation in a year. Hence option (d) is the correct answer.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The rotation of the earth about its axis affects the direction of the wind. This force is called the Coriolis force after the French physicist who described it in 1844.\nIt deflects the wind to the right direction in the northern hemisphere and to the left in the southern hemisphere. The deflection is more when the wind velocity is high. Hence statement 1 is correct.\nThe Coriolis force is directly proportional to the angle of latitude. It is maximum at the poles and is absent at the equator. Hence statement 2 is correct.\nThe Coriolis force acts perpendicular to the pressure gradient force. The pressure gradient force is perpendicular to an isobar. The higher the pressure gradient force, the more is the velocity of the wind and the larger is the deflection in the direction of wind. As a result of these two forces operating perpendicular to each other, in the low-pressure areas the wind blows around it.\nAt the equator, the Coriolis force is zero and the wind blows perpendicular to the isobars. The low pressure gets filled instead of getting intensified. That is the reason why tropical cyclones are not formed near the equator",

The secondary sector covers activities in which natural products are changed into other forms through ways of manufacturing that we associate with industrial activity. Some examples are production of bicycles, scooters, spinning and weaving etc. Most of these activities are carried out in a factory or mill. Hence pair 4 is correctly matched. The tertiary sector includes units producing only services like banks, transport shops, insurance government department, domestic servants, etc. These are activities that help in the development of the primary and secondary sectors. These activities, by themselves, do not produce a good but they are an aid or a support for the production process. For example, goods that are produced in the primary or secondary sector would need to be transported by trucks or trains and then sold in wholesale and retail shops. At times, it may be necessary to store these in godowns. Transport, storage, communication, banking, trade are some examples of tertiary activities. Hence pair 1 is not correctly matched.

      "explanation": "A company satisfying any of the following criteria during the immediately preceding financial year is required to comply with CSR provisions specified under section 135(1) of the Companies Act, 2013 read with the Companies (CSR Policy) Rules, 2014 made thereunder:\n(i) net worth of rupees five hundred crore or more, or\n(ii) turnover of rupees one thousand crore or more, or\n(iii) net profit of rupees five crore or more.\nSection 135 of the Companies Act 2013 (Act), mandates that certain companies must allocate at least 2% of their average net profits from the preceding three financial years towards CSR activities. Hence statement 2 is not correct.\nUnder the Companies (CSR Policy) Rules, 2014, any activity benefitting employees of the company shall not be considered as eligible CSR activity. As per the rule, any activity designed exclusively for the benefit of employees shall be considered as an 'activity benefitting employees' and will not qualify as permissible CSR expenditure. Hence statement 1 is correct.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators (RTGs) are lightweight, compact spacecraft power systems that are extraordinarily reliable. RTGs provide electrical power using heat from the natural radioactive decay of plutonium-238, in the form of plutonium oxide. The large difference in temperature between this hot fuel and the cold environment of space is applied across special solid-state metallic junctions called thermocouples, which generates an electrical current using no moving parts.\nElimination technique could have been used if statement 3 was difficult especially because of its second part.\nStatement 1 is not correct as the principles are different. Thus, options (a), (c) and (d) are incorrect. Statement 2 is correct as its use in the spacecrafts has been its primary applications. NASA has been using the technology since the 1960s.\nStatement 3 is correct: Pu-238 is used due to its low half-life.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Giant Stars: Giant stars have masses from eight times to as much as 100 times that of the mass of our sun. These massive stars have hotter and denser cores than dwarf stars (stars that are smaller than five times the mass of our sun). Therefore, giant stars have a greater rate of the nuclear reactions that light up stars. Massive stars also use up the hydrogen fuel in their core faster, despite starting out with much more of it, meaning they live much shorter lives than dwarf stars. A giant star will also end its life in a spectacular fashion, via a supernova explosion, leaving behind a strange object such as a neutron star or an even more bizarre black hole.\nStatement I is not correct and statement 2 is correct: Giant stars are short-lived due to the faster rates of nuclear reactions.

They were designed to operate with the help of digital programs and fly-bywire to counter the threats they counter on the battlefield. Sophisticated avionics, stealth technology and super maneuverability are just a few advantages over older jets that gives them domination in the sky. Being invisible to the enemies is a priority for the engineers, but it is also an extremely hard task for them. The stealth technology is a complex and advanced range of techniques which makes the aircraft (or any other vehicle) less visible to the opponent's radars, and therefore reduces the chance of being detected.\nOption 1 is not correct: Rafael is often dubbed 4+ or 4.5 .\nOption 2 is not correct: The Mikoyan MiG-29 (NATO reporting name: Fulcrum) is a 4th-generation jet fighter aircraft designed in the Soviet Union for an air superiority role.\nOption 3 is not correct: The Tejas Mark-1A is an indigenously designed, developed and manufactured modern 4-plus generation fighter aircraft with more than 65 per cent indigenous components.",
