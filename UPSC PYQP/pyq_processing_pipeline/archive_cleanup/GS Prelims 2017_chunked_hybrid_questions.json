According to it the policy of the British Parliament was - (i) to provide for the increasing association of Indians in every branch of Indian administration, (ii) to develop self governing institutions with a view to the progressive realisation of responsible government in British India as an integral part of the empire; (iii) accordingly, the Preamble suggested for a decentralised unitary form of government. The Act divided the functions of government in two categories: central and provincial. The provincial subjects were further subdivided into transferred and reserved. Thus, in the provinces a new form of government, dyarchy, was introduced. Dyarchy means dual set of governments, e.g. accountable and nonaccountable.\nIn the transferred subjects the Governors were to be assisted by the ministers responsible to the legislature while in the reserved subjects the Governors were to be advised by the councillors who were not accountable to the legislature.",

It's banned as a food additive in Europe and Japan.\nMSG, is a glutamate, or salt of glutamic acid, a \"non-essential\" amino acid. It is a neurotransmitter - transporting messages from one nerve cell to another. Because it is said to enhance flavours, some scientists believe it \"excites nerve endings\" and exhibits \"neuro-excitatory properties\", that is the ability to stimulate neurons.

Flexible Organic Light Emitting Diodes (FOLED) fabricated on flexible plastic substates can be bent or rolled while operating. The manufacturing process of OLEDs is different to those of LCD technology. OLEDs can be printed onto almost any substrate with inkjet printer technology. That is why new applications like displays embedded in clothes or roll-up displays are possible. LCD technology engages a backlight, whereas OLED has no backlighting function.

Share of India's exports increased since 1991.\nHence, statement 2 is correct.\nBefore 1991, foreign investment was negligible. The first year of reform saw a total foreign investment of only $ 74$ million. However, investments have steadily risen since then, except for occasional blips between 1997 and 2000 and 2008 and 2012 owing to the global economic slowdown.

The Teesta River originates from the Pahunri (or Teesta Kangse) glacier and flows southward through the Sikkim Himalaya. where the Rangpo River joins, and where it forms the border between Sikkim and West Bengal up to Teesta Bazaar. Just before the Teesta Bridge, where the roads from Kalimpong and Darjeeling join, the river is met by its main tributary, the Rangeet River. Hence Statement 2 is correct.\nIt changes course southwards flowing into West Bengal. The river then goes merging up with the Brahmaputra River after it bifurcates the city of Jalpaiguri and flows just touching Cooch Behar district at Mekhliganj and moves to Fulchori in Bangladesh. Thus it does not flow directly into the Bay of Bengal. Hence statement 3 is not correct.",
