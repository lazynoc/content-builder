      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Delimitation literally means the act or process of fixing limits or boundaries of territorial constituencies in a country or a province having a legislative body. The job of delimitation is assigned to a high power body. Such a body is known as Delimitation Commission or a Boundary Commission. In India, such Delimitation Commissions have been constituted 4 times - in 1952 under the Delimitation Commission Act, 1952, in 1963 under Delimitation Commission Act, 1962, in 1973 under Delimitation Act, 1972 and in 2002 under Delimitation Act, 2002. Hence, option (d) is the correct answer. The Delimitation Commission in India is a high power body whose orders have the force of law and cannot be called in question before any court. These orders come into force on a date to be specified by the President of India in this behalf. The copies of its orders are laid before the House of the People and the State Legislative Assembly concerned, but no modifications are permissible therein by them.",

Only a Member of the Lok Sabha can make a complaint relating to unethical conduct of a member of the Lok Sabh3. This Committee cannot take up any matter which is sub-judice. Select the correct answer using the code given below:",

        "D": "1, 2 and 3"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The Ethics Committee of the Lok Sabha and its History:\nThe genesis of the formation of the Ethics Committee in Parliament can be traced to a resolution adopted at the Presiding Officers Conference held in New Delhi in October 1996 which desired the legislatures to explore the possibility of constituting an Ethics Committee. It is in pursuance of this resolution that the endeavour for setting up of the Ethics Committee in Indian Legislatures began in earnest.\nThen Vice President (and Rajya Sabha Chairman) K R Narayanan constituted the Ethics Committee of the Upper House on March 4, 1997, and it was inaugurated that May to oversee the moral and ethical conduct of members and examine cases of misconduct referred to it. The Rules applicable to the Committee of Privileges also apply to the ethics panel.\nIn the case of Lok Sabha, a study group of the House Committee of Privileges, after visiting Australia, the UK, and the US in 1997 to look into practices pertaining to the conduct and ethics of legislators, recommended the constitution of an Ethics Committee, but it could not be taken up by Lok Sabha. The Committee of Privileges finally recommended the constitution of an Ethics Committee during the 13th Lok Sabha. The late Speaker, G M C Balayogi, constituted an ad hoc Ethics Committee in 2000, which became a permanent part of the House only in 2015. Hence, statement 1 is correct.\nAny person can complain against a Member through another Lok Sabha MP, along with evidence of the alleged misconduct, and an affidavit stating that the complaint is not \"false, frivolous, or vexatious\". If the Member himself complains, the affidavit is not needed. The Speaker can refer to the Committee any complaint against an MP. Hence, statement 2 is not correct.\nThe Committee does not entertain complaints based only on media reports or on matters that are sub judice. The Committee makes a prima facie inquiry before deciding to examine a complaint. It makes its recommendations after evaluating the complaint. Hence, statement 3 is correct.",
