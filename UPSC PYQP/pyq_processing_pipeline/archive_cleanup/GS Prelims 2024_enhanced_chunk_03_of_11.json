      "question_text": "Consider the following statements regarding 'Nari Shakti Vandan Adhiniyam': 1. Provisions will come into effect from the 18th Lok Sabh2. This will be in force for 15 years after becoming an Act. 3. There are provisions for the reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes Women within the quota reserved for the Scheduled Castes. Which of the statements given above are correct?",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The Constitution (106th Amendment) Act, 2023, also known as 'Nari Shakti Adhiniyam' reserves one-third of all seats for women in Lok Sabha, State legislative assemblies, and the Legislative Assembly of the National Capital Territory of Delhi, including those reserved for SCs and STs.\n\nKey Provisions:\nWithin the 33% reservation for women, there will be sub-reservations for Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs) in line with their proportion in the population. Hence, statement 3 is correct. The reservation will be in effect for a period of 15 years from the date of commencement of the legislation. Hence, statement 2 is correct. The bill does not propose any reservation for women in the Rajya Sabha (the upper house of India's Parliament) or the state legislative councils. The reservation will come into effect after the completion of the first delimitation exercise undertaken after the commencement of the bill, ensuring that constituencies are redrawn to reflect the population changes. Hence, statement 1 is not correct.",

      "explanation": "EPA's national ambient air quality standards for SO2 are designed to protect against exposure to the entire group of sulfur oxides (SOx). According to EPA, the largest source of SO2 in the atmosphere is the burning of fossil fuels by power plants and other industrial facilities. Smaller sources of SO2 emissions include: industrial processes such as extracting metal from ore; natural sources such as volcanoes; and locomotives, ships and other vehicles and heavy equipment that burn fuel with a high sulfur content.
