      "question_text": "With reference to the Indian economy, what are the advantages of \"Inflation-Indexed Bonds (IIBs)\"? 1. Government can reduce the coupon rates on its borrowing by way of IIBs. 2. IIBs provide protection to the investors from uncertainty regarding inflation. 3. The interest received as well as capital gains on IIBs are not taxable. Which of the statements given above are correct? (a) 1 and 2 only (b) 2 and 3 only (c) 1 and 3 only (d) 1, 2 and 3",
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Inflation-indexed bonds in India were issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in 2013 and were benchmarked to Wholesale Price Index (WPI). Inflation-indexed bonds are financial instruments that attempt to protect the bonds' purchasing power by tying interest and principal payments to an index of price changes. Indexed bonds include two types of compensation, a real rate of return plus a compensation for the erosion of purchasing power. Inflation component on principal will not be paid with interest but the same would be adjusted in the principal by multiplying principal with index ratio (IR). At the time of redemption, adjusted principal or the face, whichever is higher, would be paid. Interest rate will be provided protection against inflation by paying fixed coupon rate on the principal adjusted against inflation. Hence statement 2 is correct. Economists have argued that inflation indexed bonds could reduce government borrowing costs. If the market overestimates future inflation, government will reduce borrowing costs by issuing inflation indexed bonds rather than nominal bonds. This may occur because, for example, investors' expectations are not completely forward-looking or rational. Alternatively, the government, because it is able to influence inflation through its policies, may have better information about the future course of inflation, or perhaps has more faith in its commitment to contain it than the public does. In these cases a treasury can lower its costs by issuing indexed bonds. For example, if coupon rate of IIBs is fixed $1.5 \\%$ above WPI (Whole sale price index) and current WPI is $4 \\%$, so effective rate will be $5.5 \\%(4+1.5)$. In future, when WPI falls from $4 \\%$ to $2 \\%$, then effective coupon rate will become $3.5 \\%$ (i.e. $2+1.5$ ) and thus government can reduce the coupon rates on its borrowing by way of IIBs through reducing inflationary trends. Hence statement 1 is correct. Extant tax provisions will be applicable on interest payment and capital gains on IIBs. There will be no special tax treatment for these bonds. Hence statement 3 is not correct.",
      "motivation": "IIBs were in news, as RBI tries to gauge demand for the same due to increasing inflation.",

They can sell their own goods in addition to offering their platforms as marketplaces. 2. The degree to which they can own big sellers on their platforms is limited. Select the correct answer using the code given below: (a) 1 only (b) 2 only (c) Both 1 and 2 (d) Neither 1 nor 2",
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Consumer Protection (E-Commerce) Rules, 2020 define e-commerce entity (also foreign owned) as any person who owns, operates or manages digital or electronic facility or platform for electronic commerce, but does not include a seller offering his goods or services for sale on a marketplace ecommerce entity. Hence statement 1 is not correct. Marketplace based model of e-commerce means providing an IT platform by an e-commerce entity on a digital & electronic network to act as a facilitator between buyer and seller. On other hand, Inventory based model of e-commerce means an e-commerce activity where inventory of goods and services is owned by e-commerce entity and is sold to the consumers directly. However, FDI is not permitted in inventory based model of e-commerce. According to guidelines for FDI (Foreign Direct Investment) on E-Commerce, E-commerce entity providing a marketplace will not exercise ownership or control over the inventory i.e. goods purported to be sold. Such an ownership or control over the inventory will render the business into inventory based model. Inventory of a vendor will be deemed to be controlled by e-commerce marketplace entity if more than $25 \\%$ of purchases of such vendor are from the marketplace entity or its group companies.

      "explanation": "The real sector of an economy is the key section as activities of this sector persuade economic output and is represented by those economic segments that are essential for the progress of GDP of the economy. For instance, farmers harvesting their crops or textile mills converting raw cotton into fabrics ensure increase of economic output and in turn progress of GDP. The sector is crucial for the sustainability of the economy because of its productive capability to meet nations' aggregate demand. Hence statements 1 and 2 are correct. On other hand, the financial sector is a section of the economy made up of firms and institutions that provide financial services to commercial and retail customers. The financial sector generates a good portion of its revenue from loans and mortgages. This sector comprises a broad range of industries including banks, investment companies, insurance companies, and real estate firms. Thus, a commercial bank lending money to a trading company or a corporate body issuing rupee denominated bonds overseas constitute financial sector activities and not real sector activities.

      "question_text": "Which one of the following situations best reflects \"indirect Transfers\" often talked about in media recently with reference to India ? (a) An Indian company investing in a foreign enterprise and paying taxes to the foreign country on the profits arising out of its investment (b) A foreign company investing in India and paying taxes to the country of its base on the profits arising out of its investment (c) An Indian company purchases tangible assets in a foreign country and sells such assets after their value increases and transfers the proceeds to India (d) A foreign company transfers shares and such shares derive their substantial value from assets located in India",
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Indirect transfers refer to situations where when foreign entities own shares or assets in India, the shares of such foreign entities are transferred instead of a direct transfer of the underlying assets in India. Hence option (d) is the correct answer. The origin of retrospective taxation can be traced backed to 2012, When Vodafone Ltd. was retrospectively taxed by the Indian tax authorities for a 2007 deal. The 2012 act had amended the IT act to impose tax liability on the income earned from the sale of shares of a foreign company on a retrospective basis (i.e., also applicable to the transactions done before May 28, 2012). The amendments made by the 2012 Act clarified that if a company is registered or incorporated outside India, its shares will be deemed to be or have always been situated in India if they derive their value substantially from the assets located in India. As a result, the persons who sold such shares of foreign companies before the enactment of the Act (i.e., May 28, 2012) also became liable to pay tax on the income earned from such sale. The Taxation Laws (Amendment) Act, 2021 nullifies the 'retrospective taxation' that was introduced with the Finance Act of 2012. It nullifies this tax liability imposed on such persons provided they fulfil certain conditions. These conditions are: (i) if the person has filed an appeal or petition in this regard, it must be withdrawn or the person must submit an undertaking to withdraw it, (ii) if the person has initiated or given notice for any arbitration, conciliation, or mediation proceedings in this regard, the notices or claims under such proceedings must be withdrawn or the person must submit an undertaking to withdraw them, (iii) the person must submit an undertaking to waive the right to seek or pursue any remedy or claim in this regard, which may otherwise be available under any law in force or any bilateral agreement, and (iv) other conditions, as may be prescribed.",

Its fibres can be blended with wool and cotton fibres to reinforce their properties.\n2. Containers made of it can be used to store any alcoholic beverage.\n3. Bottles made of it can be recycled into other products.\n4. Articles made of it can be easily disposed of by incineration without causing greenhouse gas emissions.\nWhich of the statements given above are correct?\n(a) 1 and 3\n(b) 2 and 4\n(c) 1 and 4\n(d) 2 and 3",
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Polyethylene terephthalate (PET or PETE), a strong, stiff synthetic fibre and resin and a member of the polyester family of polymers. PET is spun into fibres for permanent-press fabrics and blow-molded into disposable beverage bottles. Statement 1 is correct: They are often used in durablepress blends with other fibres such as rayon, wool, and cotton, reinforcing the inherent properties of those fibres. Statement 2 is not correct: Plastic packaging is dangerous to human health and the country liquor and country made foreign liquor cannot be sold in such bottles. Statement 3 is correct: PET bottles are made of one of the few polymers that can be recycled into the same form - a new beverage bottle - again and again. During the process the PET is generally blended in a ratio of virgin to recycled, to give strength to the material for use in a new product. Some other everyday items recycled plastic bottles can be made into are: Plastic packaging, Clothing and shoes, Carpets and soft furnishings, Furniture, Automotive parts etc. Statement 4 is not correct: Globally, in this year alone, researchers estimate that the production and incineration of plastic will pump more than 850 million tonnes of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Producing a 16 oz. PET bottle generates more than 100 times the toxic emissions to air and water than making the same size bottle out of glass.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Mahseer roughly translates as mahi - fish and sher tiger, and hence is also referred as tiger among fish. It is a large cyprinid and known to be the toughest among the fresh water sport fish. The Indian nightjar is a small nightjar which is a resident breeder in open lands across South Asia and Southeast Asia. The first bird to be called a \"nightjar\" was the European Nightjar (Caprimulgus europaeus) which was so named in the 17th-century because it was active at night and made a jarring noise (night + jar = nightjar). Spoonbills are a genus, Platalea, of large, long-legged wading birds. The spoonbills have a global distribution, being found on every continent except Antarctica. The genus name Platalea derives from Ancient Greek and means \"broad\", referring to the distinctive shape of the bill. White Ibises are wetland birds. They use freshwater marshes, coastal estuaries, mangroves, flooded pastures, mudflats, and swamps.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Alfalfa, also called lucerne, is a perennial flowering plant in the legume family Fabaceae. It is cultivated as an important forage crop in many countries around the world. Symbiotic N2 fixation by alfalfa provides substantial amounts of nitrogen ( N ) to livestock operations, subsequent crops, and soil organic matter. Hence option 1 is correct. Amarnath: Amaranthus is a cosmopolitan genus of annual or short-lived perennial plants collectively known as amaranths. Hence option 2 is not correct. Chickpea: The chickpea or chick pea is an annual legume of the family Fabaceae. Hence option 3 is correct. Clover: Nitrogen is \"fixed\" in clovers through a symbiotic relationship with Rhizobium bacteria that infects the plant's roots. Hence option 4 is correct. Purslane: Purslane is a green, leafy vegetable that can be eaten raw or cooked. It is known scientifically as Portulaca oleracea, and is also called pigweed, little hogweed, fatweed and pusley. This succulent plant contains about $93 \\%$ water. It has red stems and small, green leaves. Hence option 5 is not correct.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Biorock technology is an innovative process originally invented in 1976 by the late architect to produce natural building materials in the sea. Biorock technology has been successfully applied to fish and shellfish mariculture as well as to growing limestone breakwaters to protect islands and coastal areas from erosion and rising sea levels.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Urban forests are created through Miyawaki, an afforestation method based on the work of Japanese botanist Akira Miyawaki in the 1980s. The technique compresses layers of a forest - shrubs, trees, canopies - on small plots of land, turning them into tiny forests. In the Miyawaki technique, various native species of plants are planted close to each other so that the greens receive sunlight only from the top and grow upwards than sideways. As a result, the plantation becomes approximately 30 times denser, grows 10 times faster and becomes maintenance-free after a span of 3 years. Hence option (c) is the correct answer.",

      "question_text": "Consider the following statements: 1. Tight monetary policy of US Federal Reserve could lead to capital flight. 2. Capital flight may increase the interest cost of firms with existing External Commercial Borrowings (ECBs). 3. Devaluation of domestic currency decreases the currency risk associated with ECBs. Which of the statements given above are correct? (a) 1 and 2 only (b) 2 and 3 only (c) 1 and 3 only (d) 1, 2 and 3",
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Tight monetary policy implies the Central Bank (or authority in charge of Monetary Policy) is seeking to reduce the demand for money and limit the pace of economic expansion. Central banks engage in tight monetary policy when an economy is accelerating too quickly or inflation is rising too fast and usually involves increasing interest rates. Tight monetary policy of US Federal Reserve means hiking the federal funds rate—the rate at which banks lend to each other—increases borrowing rates and slows lending. Rate increases make borrowing less attractive as interest payments increase. It affects all types of borrowing including personal loans, mortgages, and interest rates on credit cards. Faster Fed rate could rattle financial markets and tighten financial conditions globally especially in emerging market economies like India. For instance, an aggressive monetary tightening would raise US yields and strengthen the US dollar against EM currencies like rupee. As a result, US-based foreign portfolio investors/Foreign institutional investors investing in countries like India would pull money out from here and invest in \"safe haven\" US assets (Treasury bonds) and thus leading significant capital flight from India. Hence statement 1 is correct. The sudden stops and reversal of capital flows will lead to depreciation pressures on emerging market currencies like rupee. When foreign investors invest in equities, bonds and other financial assets in EMEs, they measure financial returns in the US dollar and other foreign currencies. If the EM currency depreciates against the US dollar, it decreases the value of their investments in dollar terms and, therefore, they may engage in distress sales of funds. This capital flight may increase interest cost of firms with a large stock of foreign currency debt as rising US dollar would increase the debt-servicing costs (in local currencies) for firms. Hence statement 2 is correct.",

Acute scarcity of coal necessitated promulgation of Colliery Control Order, 1944 for effective control on production, distribution and pricing of coal. Subsequently, it was revised by a more comprehensive order in 1945. Later in 1996, distribution and pricing of coal was deregulated. Thereafter, Colliery Control Order, 2000 superseded the previous order. Finally, the Colliery Control Rules, 2004, was published by Government of India in August, 2004.\n\nFunctions of Coal Controller's Organization (i) Under Colliery Control Rules, 2004: (a) To lay down procedure and standard for sampling of coal. (b) Inspection of collieries so as to ensure the correctness of the class, grade or size of coal. (c) To issue directives for the purpose of declaration and maintenance of grades of coal of a seam mined in a colliery. (d) To act as the appellate authority in case of dispute between consumers and owner arising out of declaration of grade and size of coal.
