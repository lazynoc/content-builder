      "explanation": "According to Section 8 of RBI ACT 1934-\nA Governor and (not more than four) Deputy Governors to be appointed by the Central Government. Hence statement 1 is correct.\nAccording to Section 7 of RBI ACT 1934-\nThe Central Government may from time to time give such directions to the Bank as it may, after consultation with the Governor of the Bank, consider necessary in the public interest. There is no such provision in the constitution of India.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Holding that an employer cannot differentiate between contractual and permanent employees, the Supreme Court in Pawan Hans Limited & Ors. Vs Aviation Karmachari Sanghatana has ruled that casual workers are also entitled to social security benefits under the Employees' Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act.\nCode on Social Security, 2020-\nThe Code replaces nine laws related to social security. These include the Employees' Provident Fund Act, 1952, the Maternity Benefit Act, 1961, and the Unorganised Workers' Social Security Act, 2008 among others.\nThe code is applicable to any establishment (subject to size threshold as may be notified by the central government).\nSocial security fund: The code states that the central government will set up such a fund for unorganized workers, gig workers and platform workers.\nFurther, state governments will also set up and administer separate social security funds for unorganized workers.\nCode on Wages, 2020, Section 6 & 7 are related to number of regular working hours and Weekly day of rest & overtime provisions respectively.

(a) Cut in tax rates accompanied by increase in interest rate (b) Increase in expenditure on public projects (c) Increase in tax rates accompanied by reduction of interest rate. (d) Reduction of expenditure on public projects",
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Recession- It is a situation which is characterized by negative growth rate of GDP in two successive quarters. Some of the indicators of a recession include slowdown in the economy, fall in investments, fall in the output of the economy etc. If an economy experiences a recession and GDP falls, tax revenues fall because firms and households pay lower taxes when they earn less. It is prudent for government as well as central bank to follow Expansionary fiscal and monetary policy respectively to stimulate the economy, but keeping in mind the inflationary pressure. In all the given options- Cut in tax rates accompanied by increase in interest rate- Increase in interest rate results into credit crunch in the economy which is not desirable at the time of recession. Increase in expenditure on public projects- It is one of the tool to stimulate the economy at the time of recession, as it triggers the virtuous cycle of investment, which leads to increase in GDP (production of goods & services) and income in the economy and in turn increase in demand, and thus completes the virtuous cycle. Increase in tax rates accompanied by reduction of interest rate- Increase in tax rate is not desirable at the time of recession as income is falling in the economy. Reduction of expenditure on public projects- It is not desirable at the time of recession as it will lead to less government expenditure thereby not contributing much to output. Hence (b) is the correct answer.",

(a) 1 and 4 only (b) 2,3 and 4 (c) 1, 3 and 4 (d) 1, 2 and 3",
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Law of Demand- Law of Demand states that other things being equal, there is a negative relation between demand for a commodity and its price. In other words, when price of the commodity increases, demand for it falls and when price of the commodity decreases, demand for it rises, other factors remaining the same. Hence, statement 4 is correct. The quantity of a good that the consumer demands can increase or decrease with the rise in income depending on the nature of the good. For most goods, the quantity that a consumer chooses, increases as the consumer's income increases and decreases as the consumer's income decreases. Such goods are called Normal Goods. Thus, a consumer's demand for a normal good moves in the same direction as the income of the consumer. However, there are some goods the demands for which move in the opposite direction of the income of the consumer. Such goods are called Inferior Goods. As the income of the consumer increases, the demand for an inferior good falls, and as the income decreases, the demand for an inferior good rises. Examples of inferior goods include low quality food items like coarse cereals. Hence statement 3 is not correct. The quantity of a good that the consumer chooses can increase or decrease with the rise in the price of a related good depending on whether the two goods are substitutes or complementary to each other. Goods which are consumed together are called complementary goods. Examples of goods which are complement to each other include tea and sugar, shoes and socks, pen and ink, etc. Since tea and sugar are used together, an increase in the price of sugar is likely to decrease the demand for tea and a decrease in the price of sugar is likely to increase the demand for tea. Similar is the case with other complements. With the increase in price of complement, demand reduces. Hence statement 2 is not correct. In contrast to complements, goods like tea and coffee are not consumed together. In fact, they are substitutes for each other. Since tea is a substitute for coffee, if the price of coffee increases, the consumers can shift to tea, and hence, the consumption of tea is likely to go up. On the other hand,",

This marked the beginning of an era of duality of control over these banks. Banking related functions (viz. licensing, area of operations, interest rates etc.) were to be governed by RBI and registration, management, audit and liquidation, etc. governed by State Governments as per the provisions of respective State Acts. So the control of the RBI was partial and it shared the control with the registrar of cooperative societies of States, giving rise to the much-discussed dual control and the difficulties it posed to the central bank.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Devaluation means official lowering of the value of a country's currency within a fixed exchange rate system. Devaluation of a currency happens in countries with a fixed exchange rate (or also where it is managed floating rate). Example- Let us assume that prevailing exchange rate of $1 is 10 rs. So currently 1 rs is worth of $0.1. If devaluation of currency is done and now exchange rate of $1 is 20 rs, this means 1 rs is worth of $0.05. So the value of domestic currency (rs) is decreased in terms of value of foreign currency ($). Hence, statement 2 is not correct. Let us take another example to understand statement 1- If a shirt costs $8 in the US and Rs 400 in India, the rupee-dollar exchange rate should be Rs 50. To see why, at any rate higher than Rs 50, say Rs 60, it costs Rs 480 per shirt in the US but only Rs 400 in India. In that case, all foreign customers would buy shirts from India.

(a) Diversion of resources to the purchase of real estate and investment in luxury housing (b) Investment in unproductive activities and purchase of previous stones, jewellery, gold, etc. (c) Large donations to political parties and growth of regionalism (d) Loss of revenue to the State Exchequer due to tax evasion",
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Black Money- There is no official definition of black money in economic theory, with several different terms such as parallel economy, black money, black incomes, unaccounted economy, illegal economy and irregular economy all being used more or less synonymously. The simplest definition of black money could possibly be money that is hidden from tax authorities. That is, black money can come from two broad categories: illegal activity and legal but unreported activity. The first category is the more obvious of the two. Money that is earned through illegal activity is obviously not reported to the tax authorities, and so is black. The second category comprises income from legal activity that is not reported to the tax authorities. For example, let us assume that a piece of land is sold, with the payment made in the proportion of $60 \\%$ by cheque or electronic transfer, and $40 \\%$ in cash. If that $40 \\%$ cash component is not reported to the Income Tax Department, then it is black money. A large number of small shops around the country almost exclusively do business in cash without receipts. All of this could potentially be black money. Another major source of black money is income earned by companies that is routed through shell companies abroad, thereby",

Inflation-indexing wages\n4. Higher purchasing power\n5. Rising interest rates\nSelect the correct answer using the code given below.\n(a) 1,2 and 4 only\n(b) 3,4 and 5 only\n(c) 1,2,3 and 5 only\n(d) 1,2,3,4 and 5",
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Demand Pull Inflation- This type of inflation is caused by increase in demand and when the demand in the economy outgrows the supply in the economy. This kind of inflation can be described by 'too much money chasing too few goods'. One of the reasons for demand pull inflation can be the increase in money supply, by way of increased salary, increased government expenditure etc. First statement- expansionary policies whether it is fiscal or monetary. Expansionary fiscal policy is defined as an increase in government expenditures and/or a decrease in taxes. Expansionary monetary policy increases the supply of money in an economy by making credit supply easily available. so expansionary policy can cause demand pull inflation in the economy. Hence, statement 1 is Correct. Second statement- Fiscal stimulus- it is the part of expansionary policies of the government. It is used by the government to stimulate the economy by way of tax rebates, various incentives, stimulate private sector economic activities thus job creation, etc. So it can also lead to Demand Pull Inflation in the economy. Hence, statement 2 is Correct. Third statement- Inflation- indexing wages, wages in the economy is linked to the inflation which means wage moves as inflation changes in the economy. Such indexing is provided to reduce the effect of inflation on wages. For example- a worker is getting 100 rs as a wage and inflation in the economy increases to 5%, so wage of the worker increases by 5% i.e. 105 . So effective change in the wages is zero and it does not increase/decrease purchasing power. So, it can not lead to demand pull inflation in the economy. Hence, statement 3 is not correct. Higher purchasing power- If purchasing power increases in the economy (for example previously a household has an income of 100 rs and out of that 50 rs is spending, if the spending capacity of this household increases to 60 rs then it can demand more goods/services in the economy.) and it can lead to demand pull inflation in the economy. Hence, statement 4 is correct. Rising interest rates- It decreases the money supply in the economy. This may result in credit crunch in the economy. It is costlier to borrow money in the economy and it leads to decreased money supply. So, it can not cause demand pull inflation in the economy. Hence, statement 5 is not correct.",

(a) 1 and 2 only (b) 2 and 3 only (c) 1 and 3 only (d) 1,2 and 3",
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Smelting is a process of applying heat to ore in order to extract a base metal. The copper concentrates are fed through the flash smelting furnace with oxygen-enriched air. In the furnace, the concentrates are instantly oxidized, after which they melt and separate by their own reaction heat into copper matte with a grade of 65% and slag consisting of iron oxide, silica, and other compounds. Extractive metallurgical and smelting processes can be highly polluting activities. Some facilities that carry out metal and smelting processes are known to emit high quantities of air pollutants such as hydrogen fluoride, sulfur dioxide, oxides of nitrogen, offensive and noxious smoke fumes, vapors, gases, and other toxins. Due to the application of pyrometallurgical processes in copper smelters, significant air pollution occurs with suspended particles. These particles contain high concentrations of Lead (Pb), Cadmium (Cd), Nickel (Ni) and Arsenic (As). Copper slag can have heavy metals like cobalt, zinc, arsenic, lead, cadmium, barium etc. Slag can release these elements into the environment under natural weathering conditions and cause pollution of soils, surface waters and groundwater. Hence, statement 2 is correct. Organic vapors and sulfur oxides resulting from secondary smelting roasting operations and fuel combustion can cause smog, containing ozone, fine airborne particles, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide and carbon monoxide. Carbon monoxide poisoning typically occurs from breathing in carbon monoxide (CO) at excessive levels. Hence, statement 1 is not correct and 3 is correct.",

      "explanation": "Detritivores are heterotrophs that obtain nutrients by consuming detritus. There are many kinds of invertebrates, vertebrates and plants that carry out coprophagy. By doing so, all these detritivores contribute to decomposition and the nutrient cycles.\nExamples of detritivores are earthworms, blowflies, millipedes, maggots, and woodlice. Seahorse is considered a secondary consumer. They occupy a middle position in their food chain. Seahorses do not have teeth; they suck in their food and swallow it whole. Thus their prey needs to be very small. Primarily, seahorses feed on plankton, small fish and small crustaceans, such as shrimp and copepods. Fish, jellyfish and crustaceans are common secondary consumer. Hence, option (c) is the correct answer.",

After Vijayanagar fell in 1565, the ruling dynasty of Wodeyars asserted their independence and the Raja Wodeyar ascended the throne in 1578. The capital moved from Mysore to Srirangapatnam in 1610. Hence statement 2 is correct. Several states emerged as a result of the decline of the Mughal Empire. Some of them are Awadh, Bengal, Rohilkhand. The states of Rohilakhand and the kingdom of the Bangash Pathans were a fall out of the Afghan migration into India. Large scale immigration of Afghans into India took place in mid-18th century because of political and economic turmoil in Afghanistan. Ali Muhammad Khan took advantage of the collapse of authority in north India following Nadir Shah's invasion, to set up a petty kingdom, Rohilakhand.

It includes a set of design principles derived using whole systems thinking. It uses these principles in fields such as regenerative agriculture, rewilding, and community resilience. Permaculture discourages monoculture and serves to open up the possibility of growing a wide range of food grains, fruits and vegetables and thereby expanding the food basket; thus permaculture also contributes to community health. Hence, statement 1 is correct. Application of permaculture methods and introducing permaculture techniques like swales, natural mulching, rainfall harvesting, legume cultivation, have a clear role in improving soil properties, increasing soil organic matter content and reducing soil salinity. Hence, statement 2 is correct. Due to its focus on water conservation and region specific crops, it is very much suitable for arid and semi arid regions. Hence, statement 3 is not correct. Mulch is a material placed on the soil surface to maintain moisture, reduce weed growth, mitigate soil erosion and improve soil conditions.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Nagavali River forms a prime river of north eastern Andhra Pradesh and southern Odisha. The origin of Nagavali River lies in the eastern slopes of the Eastern Ghats near Lakhbahal, located at an altitude of 1,300 metres in the Kalahandi district of the Indian state Odisha. Hence option 2 is correct. Vamsadhara river rises in the Eastern Ghats on the border Kalahandi district and Rayagada district of Odisha. It runs for a distance of about 254 kilometers, where it joins the Bay of Bengal at Kalingapatnam, Andhra Pradesh. Hence option 4 is correct. Brahmani is a major seasonal river in the Odisha state of eastern India. The Brahmani is formed by the confluence of the Sankh and South Koel rivers near the major industrial town of Rourkela. The Sankh has its origins near the Jharkhand-Chhattisgarh border. The South Koel too arises in Jharkhand, near Lohardaga, on the other side of a watershed that also gives rise to the Damodar River. Both of these sources are in the Chota Nagpur Plateau. Hence, option 1 is not correct. Subarnarekha River flows through the Indian states of Jharkhand, West Bengal and Odisha. After originating near Ranchi it traverses a long distance through Ranchi and East Singhbhum. Thereafter, it flows for shorter distances through West Bengal and Odisha before joining the Bay of Bengal. Hence, option 3 is not correct.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Adenoviruses are medium-sized ( $90-100 \\mathrm{~nm}$ ), non-enveloped, icosahedral viruses composed of a nucleocapsid and a linear, doublestranded DNA (dsDNA) genome. Viruses of the family Adenoviridae infect vertebrates, including humans.\nIn a double stranded RNA form, retroviruses infect a host cell with their genome, and then are reverse transcribed into double stranded DNA, with the DNA then integrated into the home cell genome. The virus thereafter replicates as part of the host cell's DNA. Hence statement 1 is not correct.\nAdenoviruses are common viruses that cause a range of illness. They can cause cold-like symptoms, fever, sore throat, bronchitis, pneumonia, diarrhea, and pink eye (conjunctivitis).\nHIV is called a retrovirus because it works in a back-to-front way. Unlike other viruses, retroviruses store their genetic information using RNA instead of DNA, meaning they need to 'make' DNA when they enter a human cell in order to make new copies of themselves. Hence statement 2 is correct.",
