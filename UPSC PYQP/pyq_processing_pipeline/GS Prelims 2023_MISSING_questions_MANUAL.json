      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The Hoysala era (1026 CE - 1343 CE) was marked by illustrious achievements in art, architecture, and culture. The nucleus of this activity lay in the present-day Hassan district of Karnataka, India. Hence option 1 is not correct.\nThe Gahadavala dynasty also Gahadavalas of Kannauj was a Rajput dynasty that ruled parts of the present-day Indian states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, during 11th and 12th centuries. Their capital was located at Banaras in the Gangetic plains, and for a brief period, they also controlled Kannauj. Hence option 2 is not correct.\nThe Kakatiya dynasty ruled most of eastern Deccan region in present-day India between 12th and 14th centuries. Their territory comprised much of the present day Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, and parts of eastern Karnataka, northern Tamil Nadu, and southern Odisha. Hence option 3 is not correct.\nThe Seuna, Sevuna or Yadava dynasty (850 - 1334 A.D.) was an Indian dynasty, which at its peak ruled a kingdom stretching from the Tungabhadra to the Narmada rivers, including present-day Maharashtra, north Karnataka and parts of Madhya Pradesh, from its capital at Devagiri (present-day Daulatabad in Maharashtra). Hence option 4 is not correct.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Squirrels are generally small to medium-size rodents but there are few species that are giant in size like Malabar giant squirrel and Malayan giant squirrel. Giant tree squirrels are the members of the squirrel family, They are arboreal species and live mostly on trees in the forest but now also have adapted to human environments. Hence statement 1 is not correct.\nTo prepare for colder months, squirrels cache food during the spring and summer by gathering extra nuts. They bury the surplus in the area surrounding their nests, splitting it into different underground pantries to save for later. Hence statement 2 is correct.\nWhile nuts and fruits make up a majority of its diet, the Indian sun squirrel will also eat insects, other smaller mammals, and reptiles. Hence statement 3 is correct.",

Visakhapatnam : <br> Largest container port in India <br> How many of the above pairs are correctly matched? <br> (a) Only one pair <br> (b) Only two pairs <br> (c) All three pairs <br> (d) None of the pairs",
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Pair 1 is correctly matched: Kamarajar Port, located on the Coromandel Coast about 24 km north of Chennai Port, Chennai, it is the 12th major port of India, and the first port in India which is a public company. The port was declared as a major port under the Indian Ports Act, 1908 in March 1999 and incorporated as Ennore Port Limited under the Companies Act, 1956 in October 1999. The Kamarajar Port is the only corporatized major port and is registered as a company. <br> Pair 2 is correctly matched: Port of Mundra is India's biggest private port. Located in the Kutch district of the state of Gujarat, Mundra lies on the north shores of the Gulf of Kutch. <br> Pair 3 is not correctly matched: The Jawaharlal Nehru Port Authority (JNPA) at Navi Mumbai is the premier container handling port in India, accounting for around 50% of the total containerized cargo volume, across the major ports of India. Commissioned on 26th May 1989, in three decades of its operations, JNPA has transformed from a bulk-cargo terminal to become the premier container port in the country. JNPA is connected to over 200 ports in the world and is ranked 26th in the list of top 100 Container Ports globally.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Tropical Deciduous Forests:\nA deciduous forest is a biome dominated by deciduous trees which lose their leaves seasonally. These are the most widespread forests in India. They are also called the monsoon forests. They spread over regions which receive rainfall between 70-200 cm. On the basis of the availability of water, these forests are further divided into moist and dry deciduous.\nThe Moist deciduous forests are more pronounced in the regions which record rainfall between 100-200 cm. These forests are found in the northeastern states along the foothills of Himalayas, eastern slopes of the Western Ghats and Odisha. Teak (Tectona grandis), sal, shisham, hurra, mahua (Madhuca indica), amla, semul, kusum, and sandalwood etc. are the main species of these forests. Hence options 2 and 3 are correct.\nThe Dry deciduous forest covers vast areas of the country, where rainfall ranges between 70-100 cm. On the wetter margins, it has a transition to the moist deciduous, while on the drier margins to thorn forests. These forests are found in rainier areas of the Peninsula and the plains of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. In the higher rainfall regions of the Peninsular plateau and the northern Indian plain, these forests have a parkland landscape with open stretches in which teak and other trees interspersed with patches of grass are common. As the dry season begins, the trees shed their leaves completely and the forest appears like a vast grassland with naked trees all around. Tendu, palas, amaltas, bel, khair, axlewood, etc. are the common trees of these forests. In the western and southern part of Rajasthan, vegetation cover is very scanty due to low rainfall and overgrazing.\nJackfruit, (Artocarpus heterophyllus), evergreen tree (family Moraceae) native to tropical Asia and widely grown throughout the wetland tropics for its large fruits and durable wood. It is the largest tree-borne fruit in",

Switzerland is consistently the world's leading gold exporting country based on value. Statement II is not correct: Australia is way out in front as the country with the largest gold mine reserves in the world at 10,000 tonnes. Russia is ranked second on the USGS's list of the countries with the biggest gold mine reserves in the world with 5,300 tonnes - nearly half the amount of Australia.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Statement 1 is correct: Artisanal gold mining currently contributes more than 35 percent of all global mercury emissions created by people.\nStatement 2 is correct: Mercury is emitted in the combustion process of coal and other fossil fuels. Coal has much higher mercury concentrations than other fossil fuels, which explains why coal-fired power plants often emit larger quantities of mercury pollution than do power plants that burn other fossil fuels.\nStatement 3 is correct: Mercury is a highly toxic element; there is no known safe level of exposure. Ideally, neither children nor adults should have any mercury in their bodies because it provides no physiological benefit.",
