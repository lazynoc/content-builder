      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "There are a few literary traditions about the presence of Buddhism in Andhra Pradesh during pre-Mauryan period. The famous Buddhist sites of Amaravati and Dhanyakataka are associated with Buddha, as a birthplace of one of the previous births of Buddha and a preaching site of Buddha respectively. Amaravati and Dharanikota, both formed part of ancient Dhanyakataka, the capital of later Satavahanas. With the spread of Buddhism to different parts of the country many sects appeared. For example, the Theravadins had their centre of activity at Kausambi; Mathura was the centre for the Sarvastivadins; and the Bhadra Yanika sect flourished at Nasik and Kanheri. The origin of these sects may not have been originally due to differences in the doctrines. In fact, what contributed to their origin and growth were factors related to geographical diversities of the country, attitudes of various communities at the local levels and perhaps lack of coordination between the various exponents of the sects. Under the Satavahavas, the Dhanyakataka (Amaravati) region became the most important stronghold of Mahayana Buddhism whereas the Sthaviravadins were popular in the north. Hence option (a) is the correct answer.",

      "question_text": "With reference to ancient India, consider the following statements: 1. The concept of Stupa is Buddhist in origin. 2. Stupa was generally a repository of relics. 3. Stupa was a votive and commemorative structure in Buddhist tradition. How many of the statements given above are correct?",
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Stupa, Sanskrit for heap, is a mound-like (hemispherical) burial structure containing relics of Buddhist monks. E.g. Sanchi Stupa built over Buddha relics. Hence statement 2 is correct. However, concept of stupa does not have Buddhist origin. The word Stupa is mentioned in the Rigveda, Atharvaveda, Vajasaneyi Samhita, Taittriya Samhita, etc. Hence statement 1 is not correct. Rigveda refers to a Stupa raised by the King Varuna above the forest in a place having no foundation.The word 'estuka' is also used in the same sense in Rigveda, probably by then anything raised on the ground like a heap/pile might have been known as Stupa. However the Pali word 'thupa' is quite similar to the term 'Stupa'. Thupa means a conical heap, a pile or a mound or a conical or bell shaped shrine containing a relic. Stupa is regarded as a monument for veneration. But as Stupa seems to be associated with votive and commemorative and offering purposes, Stupa thus gradually was related to the ritualistic and commemorative with sectarian, affiliation with school of philosophical obligatory and was bound by aspects of social- economic life. Hence statement 3 is correct. The Buddhist texts like the Avadana Satakam, Mahavadana and Stupavadanam mentions about the commemorative aspects of the Stupa even the Jaina literature like Raya Pasenaiya Sutta refers to it. Probably in the later period, due to deep desire of the common mass to worship the lord for the sake of salvation, Stupa acquired its votive character as well.",
      "motivation": "Recently, Votive stupas (offered in fulfillment of a vow) were discovered by the Archeological Survey of India near Sarai Tila mound within the premises of Nalanda Mahavihara in Bihar.",

      "explanation": "Sangam poems are pervaded with a warrior ethic. The goal of the hero of the puram poems was pukal (glory, fame) and a heroic death was greatly valued. It was believed that the spirit of a warrior who died in battle dwelt in paradise. A poem in the Purananuru suggests that the bodies of warriors who did not die in battle were cut with swords before the funerary rites, to simulate death in battle. The practice of vattakirutal was one in which a defeated king committed ritual suicide by starving himself to death, accompanied by those who had been close to him during his lifetime. The worship of memorial stones (natukal) was a corollary of the importance of the heroic ideal. Memorial stones were erected in honour of heroes who died fighting valiantly in battle; the spirit of the fallen hero was believed to reside in these stones.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The Hoysala era (1026 CE - 1343 CE) was marked by illustrious achievements in art, architecture, and culture. The nucleus of this activity lay in the present-day Hassan district of Karnataka, India. Hence option 1 is not correct.\nThe Gahadavala dynasty also Gahadavalas of Kannauj was a Rajput dynasty that ruled parts of the present-day Indian states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, during 11th and 12th centuries. Their capital was located at Banaras in the Gangetic plains, and for a brief period, they also controlled Kannauj. Hence option 2 is not correct.\nThe Kakatiya dynasty ruled most of eastern Deccan region in present-day India between 12th and 14th centuries. Their territory comprised much of the present day Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, and parts of eastern Karnataka, northern Tamil Nadu, and southern Odisha. Hence option 3 is not correct.\nThe Seuna, Sevuna or Yadava dynasty (850 - 1334 A.D.) was an Indian dynasty, which at its peak ruled a kingdom stretching from the Tungabhadra to the Narmada rivers, including present-day Maharashtra, north Karnataka and parts of Madhya Pradesh, from its capital at Devagiri (present-day Daulatabad in Maharashtra).

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Devichandragupta - Vishakadatta. Hence pair 1 is not correctly matched. Hammira-Mahakavya - Nayachandra Suri. Hence pair 2 is correctly matched. Milinda-panha - Nagarjuna. Hence pair 3 is not correctly matched. Nitivakyamrita - Somadeva Suri. Hence pair 4 is correctly matched. For Clarification: The Indian philosopher Acharya Nagarjuna (c. 150-250 CE) was the founder of the Madhyamaka (Middle Path) school of Mahayana Buddhism and arguably the most influential Buddhist thinker/philosopher. Whereas the old NCERT Ancient India book by R.S. Sharma mentions that Menander who was an Indo-Greek Ruler (165-145 B.C.) also known as Milinda was converted to Buddhism by Nagasena (who was also known as Nagarjuna). He asked many questions to Nagasena which were recorded in a book called 'Milinda Panho'. UPSC has asked a question in Prelims 1997: Milinda Panho is in the form of dialogue between King Milind and which Buddhist monk? (a) Nagasena (b) Nagarjuna (c) Nagbhatta (d) Kumanibhatta. According to UPSC the answer was Nagasena. So when UPSC in this particular question distinguished Nagasena with Nagarjuna, then we should also consider Nagasena different from Nagarjuna. That is why we have given the answer as B.",

To remove the arbitrariness, the Supreme Court of India recognised the principle of Due Process of Law in the Maneka Gandhi case. In short, Natural Justice implies fairness, reasonableness, equity and equality. Natural Justice represents higher procedural principles developed by judges which every administrative agency must follow in taking any decision adversely affecting the rights of a private individual.\nHence option (a) is the correct answer.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "There have been several cases in which supremacy of the Fundamental Rights (FR) have been questioned vis-a-vis other constitutional provisions e.g. the Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP). During the initial fifteen months of the working of the Constitution, certain difficulties were brought to light by judicial decisions and pronouncements specially in regard to the chapter on fundamental rights. The citizen's right to freedom of speech and expression guaranteed by article 19(1)(a) was held by some courts to be so comprehensive as not to render a person culpable even if he advocates murder and other crimes of violence. The main objects of this First Amendment Act, 1951 was, accordingly to amend article 19 for the purposes indicated above. The Constitution (First Amendment) Act, 1951, enacted in 1951, made several changes to the Fundamental Rights provisions of the Indian constitution. It provided means to restrict freedom of speech and expression, validation of zamindari abolition laws, and clarified that the right to equality does not bar the enactment of laws which provide 'special consideration' for weaker sections of society. Hence option (a) is the correct answer. The 43rd and 44th amendment Acts were believed to be enacted to undo many changes introduced in the Constitution by the 42nd Amendment Act (1976). They did not aim at overcoming the judicial interpretations of the Fundamental Rights.",

In the case of disagreement between the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, there is no joint sitting for Money Bill, but a joint sitting becomes necessary for Finance Bill. How many of the above statements are correct?",
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "A Finance Bill is a type Money Bill as defined in Article 110 (a) of the Constitution. Finance Bill deals with the proposals of the government for levy of new taxes, modification of the existing tax structure or continuance of the existing tax structure beyond the period approved by Parliament are submitted to Parliament through this bill. So, it is introduced as a part of the Annual Financial Statement (i.e. Budget) under Article 112. The Finance Bill is accompanied by a Memorandum containing explanations of the provisions included in it. The Finance Bill can be introduced only in Lok Sabha. However, the Rajya Sabha can only recommend amendments in the Bill, it can not amend or reject. The bill has to be passed by the Parliament within 75 days of its introduction. Hence statement 1 is not correct and statement 2 is correct. As a finance bill is a money bill so no joint sitting of the two houses is allowed with regard to a finance bill under Article 108. Hence statement 3 is not correct. Whereas there are two categories of Finance Bills provided for in the Indian Constitution, under Article 117 (1) and Article 117 (2) which are called Finance Bill (I) and Finance Bill (II). Financial Bill (I) includes not only the subjects stated in Article 110 of the Constitution but also other legislative provisions. Financial Bill (I) is comparable to the money bill in two ways. Firstly, both of these bills can only originate in the Lok Sabha and not Rajya Sabha. Secondly, both the bills can be introduced only on the President's advice. A financial Bill (I) follows the same parliamentary procedures as any ordinary bill.",

Such areas are designated as conservation areas if they are uninhabited and completely owned by the Government of India but used for subsistence by communities and community areas if part of the lands are privately owned.\nThese protected area categories were first introduced in the Wildlife (Protection) Amendment Act of 2002 - the amendment to the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972. These categories were added because of reduced protection in and around existing or proposed protected areas due to private ownership of land, and land use. The provisions of the WLPA apply to an area once it has been declared a community reserve. Section 33 of the WLPA passes the authority of the sanctuary to the chief wildlife warden.

In the past seven decades of constitutional jurisprudence on reservations, the Supreme Court of India has consistently referred to the notions of \"efficiency\" and \"merit,\" while adjudicating the validity of various reservation policies. The Court has held in several judgments - Indra Sawhney v Union of India 1993; M Nagaraj v Union of India 2006 - that the reservation policies made under Article 16(4) of the Constitution would be limited by Article 335, which provides for \"maintenance of efficiency of administration,\" while considering the claims of the Scheduled Castes (SCs) and the Scheduled Tribes (STs) in the making of appointments to public services and posts. This was done while the Constitution does not define the term \"efficiency of administration.\" Statement 2 is not correct: Article 335 states that he claims of the members of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes shall be taken into consideration, consistently with the maintenance of efficiency of administration, in the making of appointments to services and posts in connection with the affairs of the Union or of a State.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Wular Lake is the 2nd largest fresh-water lake of Asia, situated on the foothills of Haramuk Mountain. It is spread in a total area of 200 square km covering almost 24 km in length while its breadth is 10 km . The lake lies between the towns of Sopur and Bandippore, in Sangrama, near Baramulla Road. Main source of water for Wular Lake is River Jhelum. This lake also has a small island in its center called the 'Zaina Lank'. This island was constructed by King Zainul-Abi-Din. Wular Lake is also said to be a remnant of Satisar Lake that existed in ancient times. The premises of this lake also form a popular sunset point. Hence statement 1 is correct.\nKolleru Lake is a natural eutrophic lake, situated between the two major river basins of the Godavari and the Krishna, fed by two seasonal rivers Budameru and Tamleru and a number of drains and channels, which functions as a natural flood balancing reservoir between the deltas of the two rivers. Hence statement 2 is not correct.\nOnce a haven for migratory birds, the Kanwar lake in Bihar, Asia's largest freshwater oxbow lake, is today a dying wetland ecosystem. Kanwar jheel, as it is locally called, is located 22 km north-west of Begusarai town. It is a residual oxbow lake, formed due to meandering of Burhi Gandak river, a tributary of Ganga, in the geological past. It is largest of a series of shallow permanent and ephemeral wetlands formed in the depression between River Burhi Gandak and palaeochannel of River Bagmati. Kanwar lake was declared a notified area under the Wildlife (Protection) Act of 1972. To check poaching of birds, it was declared a protected zone by the Bihar state government in 1986; the government of India declared it a bird sanctuary in 1989. The authorities had notified 15,000 acres in the area as wetland, which makes it six times bigger than Keoladeo National Park in Bharatpur, Rajasthan-another well-known bird sanctuary of India.

      "explanation": "Tropical Deciduous Forests:\nA deciduous forest is a biome dominated by deciduous trees which lose their leaves seasonally. These are the most widespread forests in India. They are also called the monsoon forests. They spread over regions which receive rainfall between 70-200 cm. On the basis of the availability of water, these forests are further divided into moist and dry deciduous.\nThe Moist deciduous forests are more pronounced in the regions which record rainfall between 100-200 cm. These forests are found in the northeastern states along the foothills of Himalayas, eastern slopes of the Western Ghats and Odisha. Teak (Tectona grandis), sal, shisham, hurra, mahua (Madhuca indica), amla, semul, kusum, and sandalwood etc. are the main species of these forests. Hence options 2 and 3 are correct.\nThe Dry deciduous forest covers vast areas of the country, where rainfall ranges between 70-100 cm. On the wetter margins, it has a transition to the moist deciduous, while on the drier margins to thorn forests. These forests are found in rainier areas of the Peninsula and the plains of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. In the higher rainfall regions of the Peninsular plateau and the northern Indian plain, these forests have a parkland landscape with open stretches in which teak and other trees interspersed with patches of grass are common. As the dry season begins, the trees shed their leaves completely and the forest appears like a vast grassland with naked trees all around. Tendu, palas, amaltas, bel, khair, axlewood, etc. are the common trees of these forests. In the western and southern part of Rajasthan, vegetation cover is very scanty due to low rainfall and overgrazing.\nJackfruit, (Artocarpus heterophyllus), evergreen tree (family Moraceae) native to tropical Asia and widely grown throughout the wetland tropics for its large fruits and durable wood.

However, with limited arable land about 120 million hectares in China, and 156 million hectares in India, both face the challenge of producing enough food, fodder, and fiber for their population. Both have adopted modern technologies in agriculture, starting with High Yielding Variety (HYV) seeds in the mid-1960s, increased irrigation cover, and use of more chemical fertilizers to get more food from this limited land. Hence statement 1 is correct. China's irrigation cover is $41 \\%$ of cultivated area, and India's is $48 \\%$. As a result of this irrigation, China's total sown area is 166 m ha compared to India's gross cropped area of 198 m ha. Even with much lesser land under cultivation, China produces agricultural output valued at $\\$ 1,367$ billion-more than three times that of India's $\\$ 407$ billion. Hence statement 2 is correct. Better seeds that result from higher R&D expenditures generally demand more fertilizer. It is worth noting that China's fertilizer consumption in 2016 was $503 \\mathrm{~kg} / \\mathrm{ha}$ of arable area compared to just $166 \\mathrm{~kg} / \\mathrm{ha}$ for India, as per World Bank estimates. No wonder, China's productivity in most crops is 50 to $100 \\%$ higher than India's. Agricultural yield is the quantity of a crop produced on one unit of land. In India agricultural yield of food grains has increased by more than four times since 1950-51, and was $3479 \\mathrm{~kg} /$ hectare in 2021 . Whereas the average yield of food grains was $6321 \\mathrm{~kg} /$ hectare. Hence statement 3 is not correct.",
      "motivation": "This question was inspired due to various studies done on low agricultural productivity in India.",

      "explanation": "Rann of Kutch is a massive expanse of cracked earth, inland from the sea, that promises to take your breath away. The nothingness for miles is both nerve wracking and stunning with small oasis of water bodies and shrub forests doubling up as homes for pink flamingos and wild asses. Tribal hamlets with cylindrical mud bhungas (huts) are the epicenter for Kutchi embroidery, tie and dye, leatherwork, pottery, bell metal craft and the famous Rogan painting by the only surviving expert family. Approximately 200 km east of the Rann, is the Little Rann of Kutch, which houses the 4953-sq-km Wild Ass Sanctuary. It homes the only remaining population of the chestnut-coloured Indian wild ass (khur), as well as blue-bulls, blackbuck and chinkara. The area was once a sprawling shallow of the Arabian Sea until a constant geological shift closed off the connection with the sea. Over the years, the region eventually became a seasonal marshy salt desert. During monsoons, the marsh fills up with water and the wetland extends from the Gulf of Kutch on the west through to the Gulf of Cambay on the east. In the summers, the water dries to create a crunchy based bed of white salty land. Hence option (d) is the correct answer.",

The Congo Basin is home to the world's largest tropical peatlands, along with Brazil and Indonesia. The peat swamp forest of the Congo Basin stores around 29 billion tons of carbon - approximately equivalent to three years' worth of global greenhouse gas emissions while the Basin as a whole absorbs nearly 1.5 billion tons of carbon dioxide a year. The Basin stretches across six countries- Cameroon, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Congo, Equatorial Guinea and Gabon.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "One of the 14 kharif crops for which the Centre releases a minimum support price (MSP) every year is an unlikely plant called niger or ramtil (Guizotia abyssinica).

In 1985-86, niger was cultivated on around 0.6 million hectares (ha). In 2020-21, the cultivated area shrunk by 80 per cent to a little over 0.1 million ha, the lowest among the 14 kharif crops with MSP.\nThe primary reason such a sparsely grown crop is part of the exclusive MSP list is because niger seed has traditionally \"been the lifeline of tribal agriculture and economy in several states across India.",

Alexander Rea was a British archaeologist who worked mainly in South British India. He is known for unearthing a sarcophagus from the hillocks of Pallavaram in Tamil Nadu. Albert Henry Longhurst was a British archaeologist and art historian, working in India and Ceylon. Longhurst was the brother-in-law of Sir John Marshall, the Director-General of the Archaeology Survey of India (1902-1928). In October 1913 he was appointed the Superintendent of the Southern Circle, Archaeological Survey of India.\nFrom 1927 to 1931 he was in charge of the systematic digging of Nagarjunakonda. Longhurst served as the Archaeological Commissioner, Archaeological Survey of Ceylon between 1934 and 1940,[2] mainly working at Polonnaruwa but also at Anuradhapura and Sigiriya, concentrating more on conservation/restoration rather than excavation.\nRobert Sewell worked in the civil service of the Madras Presidency during the period of colonial rule in India. He was Keeper of the Madras Record Office. Sewell's specialism was the Vijayanagara Empire, about which he authored A Forgotten Empire Vijayanagar: A Contribution to the History of India (1900). Sewell undertook archaeological work, including at the Buddhist stupa at Amaravati, which had already been largely destroyed prior to his arrival. The site had previously been surveyed by Colin Mackenzie and Walter Elliot.\nIn 1854, Walter Elliot, the commissioner of Guntur (Andhra Pradesh), visited Amaravati and collected several sculpture panels and took them away to Madras. (These came to be called the Elliot marbles after him.) He also discovered the remains of the western gateway and came to the conclusion that the structure at Amaravati was one of the largest and most magnificent Buddhist stupas ever built.",

      "question_text": "With reference to the Earth's atmosphere, which one of the following statements is correct?",
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The earth's surface receives most of its energy in short wavelengths. The energy received by the earth is known as incoming solar radiation which in short is termed as insolation. The insolation received at the surface varies from about 320 Watt/m2 in the tropics to about 70 Watt/m2 in the poles. Therefore, the total amount of insolation received at the equator is roughly about 5 times of that received at the poles. Hence option (a) is not correct.\nInsolation is frequently referred to as shortwave radiation; it falls primarily within the ultraviolet and visible portions of the electromagnetic spectrum and consists predominantly of wavelengths of 0.39 to 0.76 micrometres. Radiation emitted from Earth is called long-wave radiation; it falls within the infrared portion of the spectrum and has typical wavelengths of 4 to 30 micrometres. Hence option (b) is not correct.\nThe atmosphere is largely transparent to shortwave solar radiation. The incoming solar radiation passes through the atmosphere before striking the earth's surface. Within the troposphere water vapor, ozone and other gasses absorb much of the near infrared radiation.\nWater vapor is the most abundant greenhouse gas in the Earth's atmosphere, and it has strong absorption properties in the infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. As infrared radiation passes through the atmosphere, water vapor molecules can absorb and re-emit a significant portion of the longwave radiation. Hence option (c) is the correct answer. Infrared waves are not part of the visible spectrum of electromagnetic waves in solar radiation. The visible spectrum refers to the range of electromagnetic waves that are visible to the human eye, which includes wavelengths between approximately 400 to 700 nanometers. Infrared waves have wavelengths longer than approximately 700 nanometers. Most of the radiation emitted by a moderately heated surface is infrared. Hence option (d) is not correct.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "In the rainforest, most of the carbon and essential nutrients are locked up in the living vegetation, dead wood, and decaying leaves. As organic material decays, it is recycled so quickly that few nutrients ever reach the soil, leaving it nearly sterile. The high temperature and moisture of tropical rainforests cause dead organic matter in the soil to decompose quickly.\nDecaying matter (dead wood and leaf litter) is processed so efficiently because of the abundance of decomposers including bacteria, fungi, and termites. These organisms take up nutrients, which are released as wastes when organisms die. Virtually all organic matter is rapidly processed, even fecal matter and perspiration. It is only a matter of minutes, in many rainforests, before dung is discovered and utilized by various insects. Hence statement 1 is not correct and 2 is correct.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The specific heat capacity is the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of one gram of the substance by 1 degree. The specific heat capacity of water is much greater than the land because the relative density of water is much lower than that of the land surface. It means more heat is required to raise the temperature of one gram of water by 1 degree than one gram of land.\nPhysical characteristics of heat transport and ocean circulation impact the Earth's climate system. Like a massive 'flywheel' that stabilizes the speed of an engine, the vast amounts of heat in the oceans stabilizes the temperature of Earth. The heat capacity of the ocean is much greater than that of the atmosphere or the land. As a result, the ocean slowly warms in the summer, keeping air cool, and it slowly cools in winter, keeping the air warm. The temperature contrast between continents and oceans is greater during summer than in winter.\nTherefore, both Statement-I and Statement-II are correct and Statement-II is the correct explanation for Statement-I.\nHence option (a) is the correct answer.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Earthquake waves are basically of two types: body waves and surface waves. Body waves are generated due to the release of energy at the focus and move in all directions traveling through the body of the earth. Hence, the name body waves. The body waves interact with the surface rocks and generate new sets of waves called surface waves. These waves move along the surface. The velocity of waves changes as they travel through materials with different densities. The denser the material, the higher is the velocity. Their direction also changes as they reflect or refract when coming across materials with different densities.\nP-waves move faster and are the first to arrive at the surface. These are also called 'primary waves. The P waves are similar to sound waves. They travel through gaseous, liquid and solid materials. S-waves arrive at the surface with some time lag. These are called secondary waves and they can travel only through solid materials. Hence statement 1 is correct.\nP-waves vibrate parallel to the direction of the wave. This exerts pressure on the material in the direction of the propagation. As a result, it creates density differences in the material leading to stretching and squeezing of the material. The direction of vibrations of S-waves is perpendicular to the wave direction in the vertical plane. Hence, they create troughs and crests in the material through which they pass. Surface waves are considered to be the most damaging waves. Hence statement 2 is correct.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Wolbachia are natural bacteria present in up to 60% of insect species, including some mosquitoes. However, Wolbachia is not usually found in the Aedes aegypti mosquito, the primary species responsible for transmitting human viruses such as Zika, dengue, chikungunya and yellow fever. Research has shown that when introduced into the Aedes aegypti mosquito, Wolbachia can help to reduce the transmission of these viruses to people. Scientists introduced Wolbachia into Ae. aegypti. When male Ae. aegypti mosquitoes with Wolbachia mate with wild female mosquitoes that do not have Wolbachia, the eggs will not hatch. Wolbachia bacteria cannot make people or animals (for example, fish, birds, pets) sick. Hence, Statement A is correct.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Statement 1 is correct: Adding crushed rock dust to farmland could draw down up to two billion tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the air per year. The technique, known as enhanced rock weathering, involves spreading finely crushed basalt, a natural volcanic rock, on fields to boost the soil's ability to extract CO2 from the air. Statement 2 is correct: When you add lime to seawater, it reacts with that acid and neutralizes it, forming a carbonate ion. The effect is a boost in alkalinity to the ocean, and greater ocean alkalinity means more CO2 can be absorbed.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Carbon fibers can be defined as fibers with a carbon content of 90% or above. It is made up of long, thin strands of carbon that are bonded together. Carbon fiber is made by heating a carbon-containing material, such as polyacrylonitrile (PAN), rayon, or pitch, to a very high temperature in an inert atmosphere. This process causes the carbon atoms to bond together and form long, thin strands. The strands are then twisted together to form yarn, which can be woven into fabric or mats. The fabric or mats can then be impregnated with a resin, such as epoxy, to form a composite material. It is very strong and lightweight, and they are also corrosion-resistant and have a good electrical conductivity. Thus making it ideal for use in a variety of applications, including aircraft manufacturing and automobiles. Hence statement 1 is correct. Carbon fibre is not currently biodegradable. Because carbon fibre is a composite built to hold its strength and shape – most carbon fibres are difficult to recycle and repurpose – especially since they cannot be melted down and used to make new products or items.

Accelerometers are used to trigger the airbags as the sensor would send a signal when it experiences a sudden shock. In the event of a crash, the crash sensor (an accelerometer) sends a signal to the airbag control unit. This control unit triggers the inflation device, which generates nitrogen gas by igniting a mixture of sodium azide (NaN3) and potassium nitrate (KNO3).

This includes electrolysis with electricity coming from green sources such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power.\n\nVarious uses of Green Hydrogen:\nIndustry: Oil refining, ammonia production, methanol production, steel production etc.\nBuildings: Hydrogen could be blended into existing natural gas networks, with the highest potential in multifamily and commercial buildings, particularly in dense cities.\nPower generation: Hydrogen is one of the leading options for storing renewable energy, and hydrogen and ammonia can be used in gas turbines to increase power system flexibility.\nGreen Hydrogen Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle (FCEV): Powered by Hydrogen, it is one of the best Zero Emission solutions. It is completely environment friendly with no tailpipe emissions other than water. Hence statement 3 is correct.\nIt can also serve as fuel for internal combustion engines. Hydrogen has a wide flammability range in comparison with all other fuels. As a result, hydrogen can be combusted in an internal combustion engine over a wide range of fuel-air mixtures. A significant advantage of this is that hydrogen can run on a lean mixture. Hence statement 1 is correct.",

The members nominated to either House of the Parliament or the Legislative Assemblies of States are also eligible to be included in the Electoral College.\n2. Higher the number of elective Assembly seats, higher is the value of vote of each MLA of that State.\n3. The value of vote of each MLA of Madhya Pradesh is greater than that of Kerala.\n4. The value of vote of each MLA of Puducherry is higher than that of Arunachal Pradesh because the ratio of total population to total number of elective seats in Puducherry is greater as compared to Arunachal Pradesh.\nHow many of the above statements are correct?",
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Statement 1 is not correct: The President is elected not directly by the people but by members of electoral college consisting of: 1. the elected members of both the Houses of Parliament; 2. the elected members of the legislative assemblies of the states (MLAs); and 3. the elected members of the legislative assemblies of the Union Territories of Delhi and Puducherry. The nominated MPs and MLAs are not included in the electoral college.\nStatement 2 is not correct: Every elected member of the legislative assembly of a state shall have as many votes as there are multiples of one thousand in the quotient obtained by dividing the population of the state by the total number of the elected members of the assembly. This can be expressed as: Value of the vote of an MLA of a state = Total population of the state/(1000 x total number of elected members in the state legislative assembly). From the equation, it is clear that higher the number of seats in the legislative assembly, lower the value of the vote of an MLA of that state (as the number of seats forms the denominator). The Constitution (Eighty-fourth) Amendment Act, 2001 provides that until the relevant population figures for the first census to be taken after the year 2026 have been published, the population of the States for the purposes of calculation of value of votes for the Presidential Election shall mean the population as ascertained at the 1971-census. On the basis of the above formula, the value of a vote of an MLA is given for the following states and union territories: 1. Madhya Pradesh – 131, 2. Kerala – 152, 3. Arunachal Pradesh – 8, 4. Puducherry - 16. Hence statement 3 is not correct and statement 4 is correct.",
