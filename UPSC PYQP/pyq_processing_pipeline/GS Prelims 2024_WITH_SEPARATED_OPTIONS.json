      "question_text": "How many Delimitation Commissions have been constituted by the Government of India till December 2023?",
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Delimitation literally means the act or process of fixing limits or boundaries of territorial constituencies in a country or a province having a legislative body. The job of delimitation is assigned to a high power body. Such a body is known as Delimitation Commission or a Boundary Commission. In India, such Delimitation Commissions have been constituted 4 times - in 1952 under the Delimitation Commission Act, 1952, in 1963 under Delimitation Commission Act, 1962, in 1973 under Delimitation Act, 1972 and in 2002 under Delimitation Act, 2002. Hence, option (d) is the correct answer. The Delimitation Commission in India is a high power body whose orders have the force of law and cannot be called in question before any court. These orders come into force on a date to be specified by the President of India in this behalf. The copies of its orders are laid before the House of the People and the State Legislative Assembly concerned, but no modifications are permissible therein by them.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The Bharatiya Jana Sangh was an Indian nationalist political party. This party was established on 21 October 1951 in Delhi, that existed from 1951 to 1977. Its three founding members were Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, Balraj Madhok and Deendayal Upadhyaya. Hence pair 1 is correctly matched. C. Rajagopalachari was the founder of the Swatantra Party, not the Socialist Party. The Socialist Party was associated with leaders like Ram Manohar Lohia and Jayaprakash Narayan. Hence pair 2 is not correctly matched. The Congress for Democracy (CFD) was an Indian political party founded in 1977 by Jagjivan Ram. It was formed after Jagjivan Ram, Hemavati Nandan Bahuguna, and Nandini Satpathy left the Indian National Congress of Indira Gandhi and denounced her rule during the Indian Emergency. Hence pair 3 is correctly matched. The Swatantra Party was an Indian classical liberal political party that existed from 1959 to 1974. It was founded by C. Rajagopalachari in reaction to what he felt was the Jawaharlal Nehru-dominated Indian National Congress's increasingly socialist and statist outlook. Hence pair 4 is not correctly matched. Hence option (b) is the correct answer.",

This Committee cannot take up any matter which is sub-judice.\nSelect the correct answer using the code given below:",
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The Ethics Committee of the Lok Sabha and its History:\nThe genesis of the formation of the Ethics Committee in Parliament can be traced to a resolution adopted at the Presiding Officers Conference held in New Delhi in October 1996 which desired the legislatures to explore the possibility of constituting an Ethics Committee. It is in pursuance of this resolution that the endeavour for setting up of the Ethics Committee in Indian Legislatures began in earnest.\nThen Vice President (and Rajya Sabha Chairman) K R Narayanan constituted the Ethics Committee of the Upper House on March 4, 1997, and it was inaugurated that May to oversee the moral and ethical conduct of members and examine cases of misconduct referred to it. The Rules applicable to the Committee of Privileges also apply to the ethics panel.\nIn the case of Lok Sabha, a study group of the House Committee of Privileges, after visiting Australia, the UK, and the US in 1997 to look into practices pertaining to the conduct and ethics of legislators, recommended the constitution of an Ethics Committee, but it could not be taken up by Lok Sabha. The Committee of Privileges finally recommended the constitution of an Ethics Committee during the 13th Lok Sabha. The late Speaker, G M C Balayogi, constituted an ad hoc Ethics Committee in 2000, which became a permanent part of the House only in 2015. Hence, statement 1 is correct.\nAny person can complain against a Member through another Lok Sabha MP, along with evidence of the alleged misconduct, and an affidavit stating that the complaint is not \"false, frivolous, or vexatious\". If the Member himself complains, the affidavit is not needed. The Speaker can refer to the Committee any complaint against an MP. Hence, statement 2 is not correct.\nThe Committee does not entertain complaints based only on media reports or on matters that are sub judice. The Committee makes a prima facie inquiry before deciding to examine a complaint. It makes its recommendations after evaluating the complaint. Hence, statement 3 is correct.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The Government of India Act of 1935 was a significant piece of legislation passed by the British Parliament that laid the groundwork for the political structure of independent India. Here are some of its key provisions:\nEstablishment of an All-India Federation: The Act proposed the creation of a \"Federation of India\" that would include both British Indian territories and princely states. However, the federation never materialized due to a lack of support from the required number of princely states.\nDivision of Powers: The Act divided powers between the center and the provinces into three lists - Federal, Provincial, and Concurrent.\nProvincial Autonomy: The Act abolished the diarchy system introduced by the Government of India Act of 1919 and granted a large measure of autonomy to the provinces.\nIntroduction of Dyarchy at the Center: The Act introduced the concept of dyarchy at the center. Defence, External Affairs, Ecclesiastical Affairs, and the administration of Tribal Areas were reserved in the hands of the Governor-General.\nBicameral Legislature: The Act established a bicameral federal legislature consisting of the Council of State and the Federal Assembly.\nExtension of Franchise: The Act extended the franchise, increasing the size of the legislatures.\nEstablishment of a Federal Court: The Act provided for the establishment of a Federal Court.\nSafeguards for Minorities: The Act included provisions safeguarding the rights of minorities.",

Bhasa was an ancient Indian playwright who is considered one of the earliest known dramatists in Sanskrit literature.

Like Japan, Italy is known for its ageing population. More than $23 \\%$ of people there were over the age of 65 in 2019, according to World Bank data. - Nigeria and other countries in Africa are bucking the trend of population decline. Nigeria will become the world's second most populous country, with 791 million people. The new study predicts that Nigeria will have one of the largest working-age populations in the world by 2100 and see big increases in GDP. - South Korea's demographic crisis has become the top risk to economic growth and the social welfare system, with the country's population of 51 million on track to halve by the end of this century.

Firstly, because it is written by a career diplomat with four decades of experience, and hence with a vantage perspective.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "- Argentina is facing its worst economic crisis. Prices in Argentina have surged so dramatically in recent months that the government has multiplied the size of its biggest bank note in circulation by five - to 10,000 pesos, worth about $ 10$. Hence pair 1 is correctly matched.\n- Sudan is suffering one of the worst humanitarian crises in recent history after nearly a year of war. Fighting between the army, headed by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), led by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, since last April has killed tens of thousands of people, as the threat of famine looms amid international inaction. Hence pair 2 is correctly matched.\n- No, Turkey has not Rescinded its membership of NATO. But some countries think turkey can be a Trojan horse for NATO and block consensus on every decision until NATO members meet his price. Turkey today is a liability. There is no mechanism within NATO to expel a wayward member. In the past, countries withdrew voluntarily. Hence pair 3 is not correctly matched. Hence option (b) is the correct answer.",

In the northern part of the Red Sea area, extending down to $19^{\\circ} \\mathrm{N}$, the prevailing winds are north to northwest. Hence statement 1 is correct.\nGenerally speaking, the average salinity of the oceans is 35.2 ppt, about 35 parts of salt in 1000 parts of water. In the Red Sea where there is much surface evaporation and fewer rivers to bring in fresh water, the average salinity increases to 39 ppt.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "As the national debt has soared, the U.S. Treasury Department has had to borrow more money to pay for government spending by revoking the Debt ceiling. The debt ceiling sets the maximum amount of outstanding federal debt the U.S. government can incur.\nRaising or suspending the debt ceiling by US Congress becomes necessary when the government needs to borrow more money to pay its debts than is federally authorized. If Congress fails to lift the debt ceiling before the due date when the Treasury will run out of cash—the federal government will not be able to pay its obligations. Further, if United States of America (USA) were to default on its debt, holders of US Treasury Bonds will not be able to exercise their claims to receive payment. Hence statement-I is correct.\nFurther, the Currencies like US dollars are fiat currency. Fiat money is a government-issued currency that is not backed by a physical commodity, such as gold or silver, but rather by the government that issued it. The value of fiat money is derived from the relationship between supply and demand and the stability of the issuing government, rather than the worth of a commodity backing it. Furthermore, if people lose faith in a nation's currency, the money will no longer hold value. So, Treasury Bonds issued by US government are not backed by any hard assets but based on only faith of the government and if government fails to repay the debt taken, then bond holders would not have right to exercise their claims to receive payment. Hence statement-II is correct and it is the correct explanation of statement-I.",

While money in digital form is predominant in India-for example in bank accounts recorded as book entries on commercial bank ledgers-a CBDC would differ from existing digital money available to the public because a CBDC would be a liability of the Reserve Bank, and not of a commercial bank.\nThe features of CBDC include:\n- CBDC is sovereign currency issued by Central Banks in alignment with their monetary policy. Hence statement 1 is correct.\n- It appears as a liability on the central bank's balance sheet. Hence statement 2 is correct.\n- Must be accepted as a medium of payment, legal tender, and a safe store of value by all citizens, enterprises, and government agencies.\n- Freely convertible against commercial bank money and cash. Hence statement 4 is correct.\nCBDC like the physical currency is not inherently insured against inflation. However, the data collected through CBDCs has the potential to be paired with strict reserve requirements for commercial banks, creating a theoretical framework for inflation control. Hence statement 3 is not correct.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "• Chandraketugarh, located in the Ganges Delta, is actually consists of a cluster of villages in the 24 Parganas district of West Bengal, about 35 kilometres (22 mi) north-east of Kolkata. Hence row 1 is not correctly matched.\n• Inamgaon is a chalcolithic settlement located in the state of Maharashtra, India. Inamgaon is located in the Bhima river valley and was inhabited during the Chalcolithic period (c. 3300-1300 BCE). The settlement is believed to have been home to several thousand people. Hence row 2 is correctly matched.\n• Mangadu, in Kerala is a newly discovered prehistoric site where megaliths are found in large numbers. The date of the Mangadu megaliths is approximately from 1000 B.C. to 100 B.C. Hence row 3 is correctly matched.\n• Salihundam in Andhra Pradesh, India is known for its shrines dating back to the Buddhist era. The complex consists of monuments like mahastupas (large stupas), chaityas (prayer halls), viharas (monasteries), mandapas (pavilion halls), and votive stupas (smaller stupas). There is no rock-cut cave shrines here. Hence row 4 is not correctly matched.\nHence option (b) is the correct answer.",

Roughly 2.7 million people have been displaced and 1.6 million children are malnourished. Multiple military coups have occurred in the region since 2020: two each in Burkina Faso and Mali, one in Chad, and another in neighbouring Guinea. Hence statement 2 is correct.

      "explanation": "With an exodus of more than 7.72 million people since 2014, the refugee crisis in Venezuela is the largest displacement crisis in Latin America and one of the largest in the world. Several root causes generate this unprecedented flow of migrants and refugees, including a deep economic crisis, repression and democratic breakdown in Venezuela. With the sometimes tumultuous changes in governments in Latin America, Venezuelans prefer to leave receiving countries rather than go through another national crisis. Since these elements will remain throughout the year, migration flows are expected to continue and even increase in 2024. Hence statement-I is not correct. Venezuela has the world's largest proven crude oil reserves accounting for approximately 17% of global reserves. Despite the sizeable reserves, Venezuela produced 0.8% of total global crude oil in 2023. Hence statement-II is correct.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Cocoa, a native to the Americas, was a valuable crop in the earliest South American cultures. The term cocoa originated from the Nahuatl word \"cacahuatl\". Many believe that the plant first grew in the Amazon and upper Orinoco basins but the Mayans and the Aztecs eventually developed techniques to cultivate cocoa successfully. The plant was considered as a symbol of wealth for these civilizations and its beans were used as currency. Cocoa beans are the main\ningredient for making chocolate.\nCocoa beans are produced in tropical zones around the Equator, where climate conditions are well suited for growing cocoa trees. About 70 percent of the world's cocoa beans come from four West African countries: Ivory Coast, Ghana, Nigeria and Cameroon. The Ivory Coast and Ghana are by far the two largest producers of cocoa, accounting for more than 50 percent of the world's cocoa. In 2021, the Ivory Coast alone produced approximately 2.1 million metric tons of cocoa beans. Hence option (c) is the correct answer.",

      "explanation": "The Gomti is an alluvial river that originates from the Gomat Taal, otherwise called Fulhaar Jheel, found near the Madho Tanda in Pilibhit district in Uttar Pradesh, India. After flowing through an incised valley southwards through the districts of Sitapur, Lucknow, Barabanki, Sultanpur, and Jaunpur, it joins River Ganga near Varanasi.\nThe Ghaghara originates in the glaciers of Mapchachungo. After collecting the waters of its tributaries - Tila, Seti and Beri, it comes out of the mountain, cutting a deep gorge at Shishapani. The river Sarda (Kali or Kali Ganga) joins it in the plain before it finally meets the Ganga at Chhapra.\nThe Gandak comprises two streams, namely Kaligandak and Trishulganga. It rises in the Nepal Himalayas\nbetween the Dhaulagiri and Mount Everest and drains the central part of Nepal. It enters the Ganga plain in Champaran district of Bihar and joins the Ganga at Sonpur near Patna.\nThe Kosi is an antecedent river with its source to the north of Mount Everest in Tibet, where its main stream Arun rises. After crossing the Central Himalayas in Nepal, it is joined by the Son Kosi from the West and the Tamur Kosi from the east. It forms Sapt Kosi after uniting with the river Arun. The Kosi river joins Ganga in the Katihar district of Bihar. Hence option (b) is the correct answer.",

Air and water contain chemical elements, which though they may be in small quantities, are sufficient to set up chemical reactions in the surface layers of exposed rocks. Such reactions may weaken or entirely dissolve certain constituents of the rock, thus loosening the other crystals and weakening the whole surface. There are three major chemical weathering processes: 1. Solution: Many minerals are dissolved by water,",

      "explanation": "Cicadas are members of the superfamily Cicadoidea and are physically distinguished by their stout bodies, broad heads, clear-membraned wings, and large compound eyes. Several cultures regarded these insects as powerful symbols of rebirth due to their unusual life cycles. There are more than 3,000 species of cicadas, which fall into roughly two categories: annual cicadas, which are spotted every year, and periodical cicadas, which spend most of their lives underground and only emerge once every decade or two. The froghoppers, or the superfamily Cercopoidea, are a group of hemipteran insects in the suborder Auchenorrhyncha. Adults are capable of jumping many times their height and length, giving the group their common name, but many species are best known for their plant-sucking nymphs which produce foam shelters, and are referred to as \"spittlebugs\" Pond skaters are predatory bugs/insects that mainly go around picking off the dead and unfortunate animals that fall onto the water surface and are trapped there. Hence option (c) is the correct answer",

      "explanation": "Statement I is correct: Modern chewing gum is made up of four groups of ingredients that give gum its distinction flavor, texture, and bounce: \n1. Fillers, such as talc and calcium carbonate, bulk out the gum and give it satisfying heft.\n2. Polymers give gum their stretch. These are polymers such as polyvinyl acetate, along with other materials that make up the 'gum base.'\n3. Emulsifiers are chemicals that help mix flavors and colors and reduce stickiness.\n4. Softeners, such as vegetable oil, are added to the gum base to keep it chewy rather than stiff.\nStatement II is correct: Regular chewing gum has a substance called PVA (polyvinyl acetate), which is used to make tyres and glue. The gums that we consume are plastic based, and PVA, in fact also damages public property. A Research Gate report states, 'Each year, chewing gum generates more than 105 tonnes of 'plastic' garbage. Thus, the discarded non-biodegradable residue of the gum produces plastic pollution.' This waste is hard to collect or track and ends up living and polluting the earth for thousands of years.

Cheetahs produce a variety of sounds including growls, purrs that generally denote contentment, chirps (between a mother and her cubs), and an 'explosive yelp'.\nStatement 3 is not correct: Leopards are territorial and mark their territory with faeces, urine and cheek-rubbing on trees. They can also leave scrape markings on the ground, trees or logs. This communicates to other leopards passing through that the territory they are in is occupied.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The marine west coast climate (British type) is found along a relatively narrow strip of coastal Oregon, Washington, British Columbia, and southern Alaska in North America. It is likewise found along coastal Chile in South America. The marine west coast climate extends further inland into northwest Europe than in North America due to the orientation of mountains. This climate is also found on the southeast coast of Australia and New Zealand.\nThe marine west coast is noted for its mild summers and winters and, as a result, a small annual temperature range. Its location on the west coast of a continent in the midlatitudes places the climate in the path of the Westerlies. In this situation, the climate receives a constant influx of oceanic air throughout the year. The mild temperatures are a direct result of the moderating influence of ocean bodies on air temperatures. The is especially true for those situations where a warm ocean current borders the continent, like the North Atlantic Drift's effect on northwestern Europe. Temperature ranges increase as one moves away from the coast.\nThe marine west coast climate is dominated by cyclonic activity embedded in the Westerlies. Frequent cyclonic storms bring prolonged periods of rain, drizzle and fog to these west coast locations. In some locations it is not uncommon to receive as much as 250 cm (100 in) of precipitation in a year. Hence option (d) is the correct answer.",

      "explanation": "The rotation of the earth about its axis affects the direction of the wind. This force is called the Coriolis force after the French physicist who described it in 1844.\nIt deflects the wind to the right direction in the northern hemisphere and to the left in the southern hemisphere. The deflection is more when the wind velocity is high. Hence statement 1 is correct.\nThe Coriolis force is directly proportional to the angle of latitude. It is maximum at the poles and is absent at the equator. Hence statement 2 is correct.\nThe Coriolis force acts perpendicular to the pressure gradient force. The pressure gradient force is perpendicular to an isobar. The higher the pressure gradient force, the more is the velocity of the wind and the larger is the deflection in the direction of wind. As a result of these two forces operating perpendicular to each other, in the low-pressure areas the wind blows around it.\nAt the equator, the Coriolis force is zero and the wind blows perpendicular to the isobars. The low pressure gets filled instead of getting intensified. That is the reason why tropical cyclones are not formed near the equator",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The axis of the earth which is an imaginary line, makes an angle of $661 / 2^{\\circ}$ with its orbital plane. The plane formed by the orbit is known as the orbital plane. The earth receives light from the sun. Due to the spherical shape of the earth, only half of it gets light from the sun at a time. The portion facing the sun experiences day while the other half away from the sun experiences night.\nOn 21st June, the Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the sun. The rays of the sun fall directly on the Tropic of Cancer. As a result, these areas receive more heat. The areas near the poles receive less heat as the rays of the sun are slanting. The North Pole is inclined towards the sun and the places beyond the Arctic Circle experience continuous daylight for about six months. Since a large portion of the Northern Hemisphere is getting light from the sun, it is summer in the regions north of the equator. The longest day and the shortest night at these places occur on 21st June. At this time in the Southern Hemisphere all these conditions are reversed. It is winter season there. The nights are longer than the days. This position of the earth is called the Summer Solstice. Hence option (d) is the correct answer.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Occupation wise an economy is broadly divided into primary, secondary and tertiary sectors. Primary sector includes production units producing goods by exploiting natural resources. Some examples are farming, mining, fishing, dairy farming etc. Most of such economic activities are usually carried out in rural areas. Hence pair 2 is correctly matched. The secondary sector covers activities in which natural products are changed into other forms through ways of manufacturing that we associate with industrial activity. Some examples are production of bicycles, scooters, spinning and weaving etc. Most of these activities are carried out in a factory or mill. Hence pair 4 is correctly matched. The tertiary sector includes units producing only services like banks, transport shops, insurance government department, domestic servants, etc. These are activities that help in the development of the primary and secondary sectors. These activities, by themselves, do not produce a good but they are an aid or a support for the production process. For example, goods that are produced in the primary or secondary sector would need to be transported by trucks or trains and then sold in wholesale and retail shops. At times, it may be necessary to store these in godowns. Transport, storage, communication, banking, trade are some examples of tertiary activities. Hence pair 1 is not correctly matched. Further, Mineral exploration (different from mining) is a complex activity representing high end research and development for exploration of minerals. It also involves specialists and consultants for prospecting of minerals skill and knowledge based economy. Though activities involving R&D, specialists and consulting form part of Quaternary and Quinary sector, it has been historically been covered under Tertiary sector. So, in context of 3 major sectors of Indian economy (Primary, Secondary, tertiary), we can say that mineral exploration should form part of Tertiary sector per se.

Hence pair 1 is not correctly matched and pair 2 is correctly matched. Conversely, working capital addresses the short-term financial needs essential for day-to-day operational activities. Both petrol and yarn are raw materials consumed within a single production cycle and are essential for the day to day operations of their respective businesses. Hence they are categorised under working capital. Hence pair 3 is not correctly matched and pair 4 is correctly matched.",

Therefore, giant stars have a greater rate of the nuclear reactions that light up stars. Massive stars also use up the hydrogen fuel in their core faster, despite starting out with much more of it, meaning they live much shorter lives than dwarf stars. A giant star will also end its life in a spectacular fashion, via a supernova explosion, leaving behind a strange object such as a neutron star or an even more bizarre black hole.\nStatement I is not correct and statement 2 is correct: Giant stars are short-lived due to the faster rates of nuclear reactions.
