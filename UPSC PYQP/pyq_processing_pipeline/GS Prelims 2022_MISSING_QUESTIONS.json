Paddies are a potential source of anthropogenic nitrous oxide (N2O) emission. In paddies, both the soil and the rice plants emit N2O into the atmosphere.

It promises to save 15 to 20% ground water, improves rice productivity.\nOption 1 is correct: Under SRI 2kg seed is required to grow a nursery for one acre against 5kg seed required in the traditional method.\nOption 2 is correct: SRI is a holistic approach to sustainable rice cultivation. By minimizing water use and alternating wet and dry conditions, it minimizes methane production.\nOption 3 is correct: With less consumption of water, adoption of SRI saves total energy inputs. A study found in Vietnam has also proved that applying SRI methods can save around 23% of energy inputs, while increasing energy outputs by 11%.",

      "explanation": "Urban forests are created through Miyawaki, an afforestation method based on the work of Japanese botanist Akira Miyawaki in the 1980s. The technique compresses layers of a forest - shrubs, trees, canopies - on small plots of land, turning them into tiny forests. In the Miyawaki technique, various native species of plants are planted close to each other so that the greens receive sunlight only from the top and grow upwards than sideways. As a result, the plantation becomes approximately 30 times denser, grows 10 times faster and becomes maintenance-free after a span of 3 years. Hence option (c) is the correct answer.",

Under this system some subjects, such as Land revenue administration, famine relief, irrigation, administration of justice, law and order, newspapers, borrowing, forests etc., were called 'reserved' subjects and remained under the direct control of the Governor; others such as education, public health & sanitation, public works, agriculture, fisheries, religious endowments, local self governments, medical services etc, were called 'transferred' subjects and were to be controlled by ministers responsible to the legislatures.

Statement 2 is correct :The fourth Mongol invasion during Ala-ud-din Khalji reign took place only after some months of Ala-ud-din's return from Chittor in 1303 A.D. The Mongols numbering 1,20,000 horsemen under the command of Targhi moved so swiftly that provincial governors could not get time to reach Delhi to help the Sultan. Besides, a large part of the army of Ala-ud-din had left for Telingana campaign and the army left at Delhi was insufficient and weak after its tough battle at Chittor. Therefore, Ala-ud-din was not in a position to face the Mongols in an open battle. He retired to the fort of Siri and took up defensive position. The Mongols plundered the environs of Delhi and besieged the fort for two months. But as they were ignorant of the art of siege-warfare, they failed to capture the fort and withdrew. Hence statement 3 is not correct:The next major Mongol invasion took place after the Khiljis had been replaced by the Tughlaq dynasty in the Sultanate. In 1327 the Mongols invaded under Tarmashirin. Historians have differed regard Muhammad Tughlaq's policy. According to one version, he defeated the Mongols and himself chased them to drive them out.

The book has been dated between the 11th and 14th century AD) and is generally regarded as one of the longest texts in Sanskrit (after the Mahabharata) and an important text of Yoga. The book consists of about 32,000 shlokas (lines), including numerous short stories and anecdotes used to help illustrate its content.\n\nOriginally written in Sanskrit, the Yoga Vasistha has been translated into most Indian languages, and the stories are told to children in various forms. The number of Muslim scholars who collaborated with Hindu pandits in making Sanskrit works available was considerable. During the Moghul Dynasty the text was translated into Persian several times, as ordered by Akbar, Jahangir and Darah Shikoh.\nNizam al-Din Panipati rendered the widely influential Yoga Vasistha into Persian late in the sixteenth century at the behest of the Mughal ruler Jahangir while he was still a crown prince.
