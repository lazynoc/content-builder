      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Coal controller organization (earlier Coal Commissioner), established in 1916, is one of the oldest offices in Indian Coal sector. Main aim behind setting up this office was to have Government control to adequately meet the coal requirement during First World War. Acute scarcity of coal necessitated promulgation of Colliery Control Order, 1944 for effective control on production, distribution and pricing of coal. Subsequently, it was revised by a more comprehensive order in 1945. Later in 1996, distribution and pricing of coal was deregulated. Thereafter, Colliery Control Order, 2000 superseded the previous order. Finally, the Colliery Control Rules, 2004, was published by Government of India in August, 2004. Functions of Coal Controller's Organization (i) Under Colliery Control Rules, 2004: (a) To lay down procedure and standard for sampling of coal. (b) Inspection of collieries so as to ensure the correctness of the class, grade or size of coal. (c) To issue directives for the purpose of declaration and maintenance of grades of coal of a seam mined in a colliery. (d) To act as the appellate authority in case of dispute between consumers and owner arising out of declaration of grade and size of coal. (e) To regulate disposal of stock of coal or the expected output of coal in the colliery. (f) Quality surveillance with respect to maintenance of grade, loading of coal in wagons/ trucks according to laid down procedures regarding grades and sizes. (g) To grant opening / re-opening permission of coal mine, seam or a section of seam or to subdivide a mine. (ii) Under Collection of Statistics Act, 2008: (a) Coal Controller has been made the statistical authority with respect to coal and lignite statistics. Hence statement 1 is correct. (b) Entrusted the responsibility of carrying out Annual Coal & Lignite survey and publishing of Provisional Coal Statistics and Coal Directory of India. (c) Submission of monthly coal data to different ministries of central and state Govt., national and international organization. (d) Collection of Statistics relating to coal washeries. (iii) Under Coal Bearing Area (Acquisition and Development) Act, 1957: Coal Controller is the competent authority under this act to hear any objection to the Central Government's Notification relating to acquisition of coal bearing land and to furnish his reports to Central Govt. Hence statement 3 is correct. (iv) Under Coal Mines (Conservation & Development) Act, 1974 and Coal Mines (Conservation and Development) Amendment Rules, 2011:",
