      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Delimitation literally means the act or process of fixing limits or boundaries of territorial constituencies in a country or a province having a legislative body. The job of delimitation is assigned to a high power body. Such a body is known as Delimitation Commission or a Boundary Commission. In India, such Delimitation Commissions have been constituted 4 times - in 1952 under the Delimitation Commission Act, 1952, in 1963 under Delimitation Commission Act, 1962, in 1973 under Delimitation Act, 1972 and in 2002 under Delimitation Act, 2002. Hence, option (d) is the correct answer. The Delimitation Commission in India is a high power body whose orders have the force of law and cannot be called in question before any court. These orders come into force on a date to be specified by the President of India in this behalf. The copies of its orders are laid before the House of the People and the State Legislative Assembly concerned, but no modifications are permissible therein by them.",

      "explanation": "The Ethics Committee of the Lok Sabha and its History:\nThe genesis of the formation of the Ethics Committee in Parliament can be traced to a resolution adopted at the Presiding Officers Conference held in New Delhi in October 1996 which desired the legislatures to explore the possibility of constituting an Ethics Committee. It is in pursuance of this resolution that the endeavour for setting up of the Ethics Committee in Indian Legislatures began in earnest.\nThen Vice President (and Rajya Sabha Chairman) K R Narayanan constituted the Ethics Committee of the Upper House on March 4, 1997, and it was inaugurated that May to oversee the moral and ethical conduct of members and examine cases of misconduct referred to it. The Rules applicable to the Committee of Privileges also apply to the ethics panel.\nIn the case of Lok Sabha, a study group of the House Committee of Privileges, after visiting Australia, the UK, and the US in 1997 to look into practices pertaining to the conduct and ethics of legislators, recommended the constitution of an Ethics Committee, but it could not be taken up by Lok Sabha. The Committee of Privileges finally recommended the constitution of an Ethics Committee during the 13th Lok Sabha. The late Speaker, G M C Balayogi, constituted an ad hoc Ethics Committee in 2000, which became a permanent part of the House only in 2015. Hence, statement 1 is correct.\nAny person can complain against a Member through another Lok Sabha MP, along with evidence of the alleged misconduct, and an affidavit stating that the complaint is not \"false, frivolous, or vexatious\". If the Member himself complains, the affidavit is not needed. The Speaker can refer to the Committee any complaint against an MP. Hence, statement 2 is not correct.\nThe Committee does not entertain complaints based only on media reports or on matters that are sub judice. The Committee makes a prima facie inquiry before deciding to examine a complaint. It makes its recommendations after evaluating the complaint. Hence, statement 3 is correct.",

Bhasa was an ancient Indian playwright who is considered one of the earliest known dramatists in Sanskrit literature. He was the author of works such as the Madhyamavyayoga, DutaGhatotkacha, Dutavakya, Balacharita and Charudatta.",

      "explanation": "- Japan's population will more than halve, from a peak of 128 million in 2017 to less than 53 million by the end of the century. Japan already has the world's oldest population and the highest rate of people over the age of 100 . - The Italian population is also expected to more than halve, from 61 million in 2017 to 28 million by the end of the century. Like Japan, Italy is known for its ageing population. More than $23 \\%$ of people there were over the age of 65 in 2019, according to World Bank data. - Nigeria and other countries in Africa are bucking the trend of population decline. Nigeria will become the world's second most populous country, with 791 million people. The new study predicts that Nigeria will have one of the largest working-age populations in the world by 2100 and see big increases in GDP. - South Korea's demographic crisis has become the top risk to economic growth and the social welfare system, with the country's population of 51 million on track to halve by the end of this century. South Korea has previously projected its fertility rate is likely to fall further to 0.68 in 2024. Hence option (a) is the correct answer.",

Within the 33% reservation for women, there will be sub-reservations for Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs) in line with their proportion in the population. Hence, statement 3 is correct. The reservation will be in effect for a period of 15 years from the date of commencement of the legislation. Hence, statement 2 is correct. The bill does not propose any reservation for women in the Rajya Sabha (the upper house of India's Parliament) or the state legislative councils. The reservation will come into effect after the completion of the first delimitation exercise undertaken after the commencement of the bill, ensuring that constituencies are redrawn to reflect the population changes.

Hence, statement 3 is correct. The reservation will be in effect for a period of 15 years from the date of commencement of the legislation. Hence, statement 2 is correct. The bill does not propose any reservation for women in the Rajya Sabha (the upper house of India's Parliament) or the state legislative councils. The reservation will come into effect after the completion of the first delimitation exercise undertaken after the commencement of the bill, ensuring that constituencies are redrawn to reflect the population changes.

        "D": "Statement-I is incorrect, but Statement-II is correct"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "As the national debt has soared, the U.S. Treasury Department has had to borrow more money to pay for government spending by revoking the Debt ceiling. The debt ceiling sets the maximum amount of outstanding federal debt the U.S. government can incur.\nRaising or suspending the debt ceiling by US Congress becomes necessary when the government needs to borrow more money to pay its debts than is federally authorized. If Congress fails to lift the debt ceiling before the due date when the Treasury will run out of cash—the federal government will not be able to pay its obligations. Further, if United States of America (USA) were to default on its debt, holders of US Treasury Bonds will not be able to exercise their claims to receive payment. Hence statement-I is correct.\nFurther, the Currencies like US dollars are fiat currency. Fiat money is a government-issued currency that is not backed by a physical commodity, such as gold or silver, but rather by the government that issued it. The value of fiat money is derived from the relationship between supply and demand and the stability of the issuing government, rather than the worth of a commodity backing it. Furthermore, if people lose faith in a nation's currency, the money will no longer hold value. So, Treasury Bonds issued by US government are not backed by any hard assets but based on only faith of the government and if government fails to repay the debt taken, then bond holders would not have right to exercise their claims to receive payment. Hence statement-II is correct and it is the correct explanation of statement-I.",

A syndicated loan is a form of financing that is offered by a group of lenders. Syndicated loans arise when a project requires too large a loan for a single lender or when a project needs a specialized lender with expertise in a specific asset class. Syndicating allows lenders to spread risk and take part in financial opportunities that may be too large for their individual capital base. Syndicated loans involve large sums, which allows the risk to be spread out among several financial institutions to mitigate the risk in case the borrower defaults. Lenders are referred to as a syndicate, which works together to provide funds for a single borrower. Hence statement-I is correct. The borrower can be a corporation, a large project, or a sovereign government. The loan can involve a fixed amount of funds, a credit line, or a combination of the two.

However, there was no general provision for exemption from revenue payment in case of bad harvests or natural calamities. Farmers were forced to pay the revenue even during famines. Hence, statement 1 is incorrect. Under the Permanent Settlement in Bengal, introduced by Lord Cornwallis in 1793, if a Zamindar failed to pay his revenues to the state on or before the fixed date, their land would auctioned off. Hence statement 2 is correct. Hence option (b) is the correct answer.",
