        "explanation": "The correct answer is A because only the first row is correctly matched: Dhuandhar waterfall is on Narmada River in Malwa region. Hundru is on Subarnarekha but in Chota Nagpur, which is correct, but Gersoppa (Jog Falls) is on Sharavati River in Western Ghats, not Netravati, making the third row incorrect. Analysis shows two rows correct (first and second), but question asks for correctly matched, and per UPSC key, only one is fully correct, wait no: Wait, actual verification: Dhuandhar - Narmada, Malwa correct; Hundru - Subarnarekha, Chota Nagpur correct; Gersoppa - Sharavati, not Netravati, so incorrect. Thus only two correct, but provided correct is A (only one)? Wait, error in my recall: Upon check, Gersoppa is on Sharavati, not Netravati, so third wrong. But is second correct? Hundru is on Subarnarekha in Chota Nagpur - yes. Dhuandhar is on Narmada, but region is Bhedaghat in Jabalpur, which is in Mahakoshal, not strictly Malwa? Malwa is typically Madhya Pradesh plateau, but Dhuandhar is in Jabalpur, often associated with Baghelkhand or Mahakoshal, not Malwa. So first row incorrect. Hundru correct, Gersoppa incorrect (river wrong). So only one correct. Yes, that's why A. Options B, C, D wrong because not two, not three, not none.",
