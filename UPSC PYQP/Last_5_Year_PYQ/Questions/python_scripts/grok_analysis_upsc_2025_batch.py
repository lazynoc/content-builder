UPSC 2025 Grok Analysis Script - Batch Processing Version
Processes 5 questions at a time to reduce API calls and costs

IMPROVEMENTS OVER PREVIOUS VERSIONS:
====================================

1. BATCH PROCESSING (Cost Optimization):
   - Processes 5 questions per API call instead of 1
   - Reduces API calls from 100 to 20 for full dataset
   - Eliminates repetitive prompt overhead
   - Estimated 70-80% cost reduction

2. ENHANCED JSON PARSING (Addresses Previous Failures):
   - Multiple fallback methods for JSON extraction
   - Method 1: ```json blocks
   - Method 2: Any ``` code blocks  
   - Method 3: Direct JSON content
   - Better error handling and content cleanup
   - Detailed error logging for debugging

3. IMPROVED TIMEOUT HANDLING:
   - Increased timeout from 120s to 180s for batch processing
   - Longer retry delays (20s vs 10s) for batch failures
   - Better timeout error messages

4. PROGRESSIVE SAVING:
   - Saves progress after each batch
   - Prevents data loss if script fails mid-process
   - Allows resuming from last successful batch

5. BETTER ERROR RECOVERY:
   - Fallback analysis for individual questions in failed batches
   - Continues processing even if some batches fail
   - Detailed logging of what succeeded/failed

6. RATE LIMITING OPTIMIZATION:
   - 15-second delays between batches (vs 3s between individual questions)
   - Respects Grok API rate limits (120 requests/minute)
   - Prevents API throttling

PREVIOUS ISSUES ADDRESSED:
- JSON parsing failures → Multiple extraction methods
- Timeout errors → Increased timeout + better retry logic  
- Individual API call failures → Batch processing with fallbacks
- Data loss on failures → Progressive saving
- High costs → Batch processing reduces API calls by 80%
