Process the following 5 question blocks and convert them into a structured JSON format suitable for a test-taking environment.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. Use the EXACT question numbers from the markdown blocks (e.g., if block shows "22", use question_number: 22)
2. Break lines where they naturally break in the original content
3. If there are tables, format them as structured data that frontend can easily recognize
4. If there are formulas, preserve them in proper mathematical format
5. Make questions suitable for test-taking - clear, concise, and well-formatted
6. Ensure options are properly numbered and formatted
7. Preserve all technical accuracy and educational value

IMPORTANT FORMATTING RULES:
- "question_text" should contain ONLY the question statement, NOT the options
- Remove all option numbers (1, 2, 3, 4) from the question_text
- Put all options in the separate "options" array
- Clean up any "You: 00:00 Avg: 00:20 | +1.33 -0.44" timestamps from question_text

DYNAMIC FORMATTING GUIDELINES:
- Analyze the content structure and choose the most appropriate format:
  * For tables: Use pipe-separated format, HTML table tags, or structured arrays depending on complexity
  * For lists: Use bullet points (‚Ä¢), numbered lists, or structured arrays based on content type
  * For matching questions: Use clear column separation or structured format that's easy to read
  * For mathematical formulas: Use proper mathematical notation
  * For code snippets: Use code blocks or inline formatting
  * For diagrams: Use ASCII art or structured text representation
- Choose the format that will be most readable and user-friendly in a test-taking interface
- Ensure the format is consistent and easy to parse by frontend applications

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return a JSON array with each question having this structure:
{
  "question_number": <EXACT number from markdown>,
  "type": "mcq",
  "difficulty": "Easy/Medium/Hard",
  "subject": "<subject category>",
  "exam_info": "UPPSC Prelims 2024",
  "question_text": "<ONLY the question statement, no options, with proper formatting for tables/lists>",
  "options": [
    {"letter": "1", "text": "<option text>"},
    {"letter": "2", "text": "<option text>"},
    {"letter": "3", "text": "<option text>"},
    {"letter": "4", "text": "<option text>"}
  ],
  "correct_answer": <1-4>,
  "explanation": "<detailed explanation with proper formatting>"
}

IMPORTANT: Return ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any text before or after the JSON array.

Here are the 5 question blocks to process:
