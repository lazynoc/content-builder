    "content": "# India - Size and Location \n\nIndia is one of the ancient civilisations in the world. It has achieved multi-faceted socioeconomic progress during the last five decades. It has moved forward displaying remarkable progress in the field of agriculture, industry, technology and overall economic development. India has also contributed significantly to the making of world history.\n\n## Location\n\nIndia is a vast country. Lying entirely in the Northern hemisphere (Figure 1.1) the main land extends between latitudes $8^{\\circ} 4^{\\prime} \\mathrm{N}$ and $37^{\\circ} 6^{\\prime} \\mathrm{N}$ and longitudes $68^{\\circ} 7^{\\prime} \\mathrm{E}$ and $97^{\\circ} 25^{\\prime} \\mathrm{E}$.\n\nThe Tropic of Cancer $\\left(23^{\\circ} 30^{\\prime} \\mathrm{N}\\right)$ divides the country into almost two equal parts. To the southeast and southwest of the mainland, lie the Andaman and Nicobar islands and the Lakshadweep islands in Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea respectively. Find out the extent of these groups of islands from your atlas.\n\nDo You Know?\n\n- The southernmost point of the Indian Union- 'Indira Point' got submenged under the sea water in 2004 during the Tsunami.\n\n\n## Size\n\nThe land mass of India has an area of 3.28 million square km . India's total area accounts for about 2.4 per cent of the total geographical\n\n\n**[IMAGE: A world map showing the continents and major oceans with their names.]**\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1 : India in the World",

    "content": "area of the world. From Figure 1.2 it is clear that India is the seventh largest country of the world. India has a land boundary of about $15,200 \\mathrm{~km}$ and the total length of the coastline of the mainland, including Andaman and Nicobar and Lakshadweep, is $7,516.6 \\mathrm{~km}$.\n\nIndia is bounded by the young fold mountains in the northwest, north and northeast. South of about $22^{\\circ}$ north latitude, it begins to taper, and extends towards the Indian Ocean, dividing it into two seas, the Arabian Sea on the west and the Bay of Bengal on its east.\n\nLook at Figure 1.3 and note that the latitudinal and longitudinal extent of the mainland is about $30^{\\circ}$. Despite this fact, the east-west extent appears to be smaller than the north-south extent.\n\nFrom Gujarat to Arunachal Pradesh, there is a time lag of two hours. Hence, time along the Standard Meridian of India ( $82^{\\circ} 30^{\\prime} \\mathrm{E}$ ) passing through Mirzapur (in Uttar Pradesh) is taken as the standard time for the whole country. The latitudinal extent influences the duration of day and night, as one moves from south to north.\n\n## Find out\n\n- Why $82^{\\circ} 30^{\\prime} \\mathrm{E}$ has been selected as the Standard Meridian of India?\n- Why is the difference between the durations of day and night hardly felt at Kanniyakumari but not so in Kashmir?\n\n\n## India and the World\n\nThe Indian landmass has a central location between the East and the West Asia. India is a southward extension of the Asian continent. The trans Indian Ocean routes, which connect the countries of Europe in the West and the countries of East Asia, provide a strategic central location to India. Note that the Deccan Peninsula protrudes into the Indian Ocean, thus helping India to establish close contact with West Asia, Africa and Europe from the western coast and with Southeast and East Asia from the eastern coast. No other country has a long coastline on the Indian Ocean as India has and indeed, it is India's eminent position in the Indian Ocean, which justifies the naming of an Ocean after it.\n\n## Do You Know?\n\nSince the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869, India's distance from Europe has been reduced by $7,000 \\mathrm{~km}$.\n\n\n**[IMAGE: A bar chart showing the area in square kilometers of the top seven largest countries in the world.]**\n\n\n\nSource : United Nations Demographic Year Book 2015\nFigure 1.2 : Seven Largest Countries of the World",
