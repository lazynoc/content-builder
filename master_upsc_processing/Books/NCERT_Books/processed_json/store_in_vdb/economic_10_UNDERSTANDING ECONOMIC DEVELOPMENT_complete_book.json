      "content": "# NOTES FOR THE TEACHER \n\n## CHAPTER I : DEVELOPMENT\n\nDevelopment has many aspects. The purpose of this chapter is to enable students to understand this idea. They have to understand that people have different perspectives on development and there are ways by which we can arrive at common indicators for development. To do this, we have used situations that they can respond to in an intuitive manner; we have also presented analysis that is more complex and macro in nature.\n\nHow can countries or states be compared using some selected development indicators is another question that students would read about in this chapter. Economic development can be measured and income is the most common method for measuring development. However, the income method, though useful, has several weaknesses. Hence, we need newer ways of looking at development using indicators of quality of life and environmental sustainability.\n\nIt is necessary for you to expect the students to respond actively in the classroom and on a topic such as the above, there would be wide variation in opinion and possibility of debate. Allow students to argue their point of view. At the end of each section there are a few questions and activities. These serve two purposes: first, they recap the ideas discussed in the section and second, they\nenable better understanding of the themes discussed by bringing the learners closer to their real life situations.\n\nThere are certain terms used in this chapter that would require clarification Per Capita Income, Literacy Rate, Infant Mortality Rate, Attendance Ratio, Life Expectancy, Gross Enrolment Ratio, and Human Development Index. Though data pertaining to these terms are provided, these would need further explanation. You may also need to clarify the concept of Purchasing Power Parity that is used to calculate Gross National Income per capita in Table 1.6. It is necessary to keep in mind that these terms are used as an aid to the discussion and not something to be memorised.\n\n## Sources for Information\n\nThe data for this chapter is taken from reports published by the Government of India (Economic Survey, Reports of the National Family Health Survey and Handbook of Statistics on the Indian Economy), United Nations Development Programme (Human Development Report) and World Bank (World Development Indicators). Many of these reports are published every year. It may be interesting to look up these reports if they are available in your school library. If not, you may log on to the websites of these institutions (www.budgetindia.nic.in, www.undp.org,www.worldbank.org, www.rbi.org).",

We have aspirations or desires about what we would like to do and how we would like to live. Similarly, we have ideas about what a country should be like. What are the essential things that we require? Can life be better for all? How should people live together? Can there be more equality? Development involves thinking about these questions and about the ways in which we can work towards achieving these goals. This is a complex task and in this chapter we shall make a beginning at understanding development. You will learn more about these issues in greater depth in higher classes. Also, you will find answers to many of these questions not just in economics but also in your course in history and political science. This is because the way we live today is influenced by the past. We can't desire for change without being aware of this. In the same way, it is only through a democratic political process that these hopes and possibilities can be achieved in real life.\n\n\n**[IMAGE: A diagram depicting urban life with scenes of people in various activities, including a man riding a bicycle and people in buildings.]**\n\n\n\"Without me they cannot develop... in this system I cannot develop!\"\n\n# DEVELOPMENT",

They might resent this and may prefer small check dams or tanks to irrigate their land.\n\nSo, two things are quite clear: one, different persons can have different developmental goals and two, what may be development for one may not be development for the other.

In other words, they want more income.\n\nBesides seeking more income, oneway or the other, people also seek things like equal treatment, freedom, security, and respect of others. They resent discrimination. All these are important goals. In fact, in some cases, these may be more important than\nmore income or more consumption because material goods are not all that you need to live.\n\nMoney, or material things that one can buy with it, is one factor on which our life depends. But the quality of our life also depends on non-material things mentioned above. If it is not obvious to you, then just think of the role of your friends in your life. You may desire their friendship. Similarly, there are many things that are not easily measured but they mean a lot to our lives. These are often ignored.\n\nA demonstration meeting against raising the height of Sardar\nSarovar Dam on\nNarmada River\n\n\n**[IMAGE: A large crowd gathered for a political event under a blue canopy with speakers addressing the audience.]**\n\n",

      "content": "However, it will be wrong to conclude that what cannot be measured is not important.\n\nConsider another example. If you get a job in a far off place, before accepting it you would try to consider many factors, apart from income, such as facilities for your family, working atmosphere, or opportunity to learn. In another case, a job may give you less pay but may offer regular employment that enhances your sense of security. Another job, however, may offer high pay but no job security and also leave no time for your family. This will reduce your sense of security and freedom.\n\nSimilarly, for development, people look at a mix of goals. It is true that if women are engaged in paid work, their dignity in the household and society increases. However, it is also the case that if there is respect for women there would be more sharing of housework and a greater acceptance of women working outside. A safe and secure environment may allow more women to take up a variety of jobs or run a business.\n\nHence, the developmental goals that people have are not only about better income but also about other important things in life.\n\n# LET'S WORK THESE OUT \n\n1. Why do different persons have different notions of development? Which of the following explanations is more important and why?\n(a) Because people are different.\n(b) Because life situations of persons are different.\n2. Do the following two statements mean the same? Justify your answer.\n(a) People have different developmental goals.\n(b) People have conflicting developmental goals.\n3. Give some examples where factors other than income are important aspects of our lives.\n4. Explain some of the important ideas of the above section in your own words.\n\n## NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT\n\nIf, as we have seen above, individuals seek different goals, then their notion of national development is also likely to be different. Discuss among yourselves on what India should do for development.\n\nMost likely, you would find that different students in the class have given different answers to the above question. In fact, you might yourself think of many different answers and not be too sure of any of these. It is very important to keep in mind that\ndifferent persons could have different as well as conflicting notions of a country's development.\n\nHowever, can all the ideas be considered equally important? Or, if there are conflicts how does one decide? What would be a fair and just path for all? We also have to think whether there is a better way of doing things. Would the idea benefit a large number of people or only a small group? National development means thinking about these questions.",

      "content": "# HOW TO COMPARE DIFFERENT COUNTRIES OR STATES? \n\nYou might ask if development can mean different things, how come some countries are generally called developed and others underdeveloped? Before we come to this, let us consider another question.\n\nWhen we compare different things, they could have similarities as well as differences. Which aspects do we use to compare them? Let us look at students in the class itself. How do we compare different students? They differ in their height, health, talents and interests. The healthiest student may not be the most studious one. The most intelligent student may not be the friendliest one. So, how do we compare students? The criterion we may use depends on the purpose of comparison. We use different criterion to choose a sports team, a debate team, a music team or a team to organise a picnic. Still, if for some purpose, we have to choose the criterion for the all-round progress of children in the class, how shall we do it?\n\nUsually we take one or more important characteristics of persons and compare them based on these characteristics. Of course, there can be differences about what are important characteristics that should form the basis of comparison: friendliness and spirit of cooperation, creativity or marks secured?\n\nThis is true of development too. For comparing countries, their income is considered to be one of the most important attributes. Countries with higher income are\nmore developed than others with less income. This is based on the understanding that more income means more of all things that human beings need. Whatever people like, and should have, they will be able to get with greater income. So, greater income itself is considered to be one important goal.\n\nNow, what is the income of a country? Intuitively, the income of the country is the income of all the residents of the country. This gives us the total income of the country.\n\nHowever, for comparison between countries, total income is not such an useful measure. Since, countries have different populations, comparing total income will not tell us what an average person is likely to earn. Are people in one country better off than others in a different country? Hence, we compare the average income which is the total income of the country divided by its total population. The average income is also called per capita income.\n\nIn World Development Reports, brought out by the World Bank, this criterion is used in classifying countries. Countries with per capita income of US\\$ 63,400 per annum and above in 2023, are called high income or rich countries and those with per capita income of about US\\$ 2400 or less are called low-income countries. India comes in the category of low middle income countries because its per capita income in 2023 was just about US\\$ 10030 per annum. The rich countries, excluding countries of Middle East and certain other small countries, are generally called developed countries.",

Even though both the countries have identical average income, country $A$ is preferred because it has more equitable distribution. In this country people are neither very rich nor extremely poor. On the other hand most citizens in country $B$ are poor and one person is extremely rich.

      "content": "# INCOME AND OTHER CRITERIA \n\nWhen we looked at individual aspirations and goals, we found that people not only think of better income but also have goals such as security, respect for others, equal treatment, freedom, etc. in mind. Similarly, when we think of a nation or a region, we may, besides average income, think of other equally important attributes.\n\nTABLE 1.3 PER CAPITA INCOME OF SELECT STATES\n\n| State | Per Capita Income <br> for 2021-22 (in Rs) |\n| :-- | :--: |\n| Haryana | $2,64,729$ |\n| Kerala | $2,34,405$ |\n| Bihar | 47,498 |\n\nSource : Economic Survey 2020-21, P.A 29.\n\nWhat could these attributes be? Let us examine this through an example. Table 1.3 gives the per capita income of Haryana, Kerala and Bihar. Actually, these figures are of Per Capita Net State Domestic Product at Current Prices for 2021-22. Let us ignore what this complicated term exactly means. Roughly, we can take it to be the per capita income of the state. We find that of the three, Haryana has the highest per capita\nincome and Bihar is at the bottom. This means that, on an average, a person in Haryana earned Rs $2,64,729$ in one year whereas, on an average, a person in Bihar earned only around Rs. 47,500. So, if per capita income were to be used as the measure of development, Haryana will be considered the most developed and Bihar the least developed state of the three. Now, let us look at certain other data pertaining to these states given in Table 1.4.\n\nTABLE 1.4 SOME COMPARATIVE DATA ON HARYANA, KERALA, AND BIHAR\n\n| State | Infant Mortality <br> Rate per 1,000 <br> live births (2020) | Literacy Rate \\% |  |\n| :-- | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n|  |  | $2017-18$ | Net Attendance Ratio (per <br> 100 persons) secondary stage <br> (aged 15-17 years) 2017-18 |\n| Haryana | 28 | 82 | 73 |\n| Kerala | 6 | 94 | 94 |\n| Bihar | 27 | 62 | 69 |\n\nSources : Economic Survey 2023-24, National Sample Survey Organisation (Report No. 585), National Statistical Office, Government of India; National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5) 2019-21 IIPS, Mumbai.\n\nExplanation of some of the terms used in this table:\nInfant Mortality Rate (or IMR) indicates the number of children that die before the age of one year as a proportion of 1000 live children born in that particular year.\nLiteracy Rate measures the proportion of literate population in the 7-and-above age group.\nNet Attendance Ratio is the total number of children of age group of 15-17 years attending school as a percentage of total number of children in the same age group.",

      "content": "What does this table show? The first column of the table shows that in Kerala, out of 1000 children born, 6 died before completing one year of age but in Haryana the proportion of children dying within one year of birth was 28 , which is nearly three times more than that of Kerala. On the other hand, the per capita income of Haryana is more than that of Kerala as shown in Table 1.3. Just think of how dear you are to your parents, think of how every one is so happy when a child is born. Now, try to think of parents whose children die before they even celebrate their first birthday. How painful it must be to these parents? Next, note the year to which this data pertains. This was during 2018. So we are not talking of old times; it is 70 years after independence when our metro cities are full of high rise buildings and shopping malls!\n\nThe problem does not end with Infant Mortality Rate. The last column of table 1.4 shows that about one-third of the children aged 15-17 years in Bihar are not attending school in secondary classes. This means that if you went to school in Bihar nearly one-third of your class friends would be missing. Those who could have been in school are not there! If this had happened to you, you would not be able to read what you are reading now.\n\n\n**[IMAGE: A doctor and a nurse examining a newborn baby.]**\n\n\n\nMost babies require basic healthcare\n\n# PUBLIC FACILITIES \n\nHow is it that the average person in Haryana has more income than the average person in Kerala but lags behind in these crucial areas? The reason is - money in your pocket cannot buy all the goods and services that you may need to live well. So, income by itself is not a completely adequate indicator of material goods and services that citizens are able to use. For example, normally, your money cannot buy you a pollution-free environment or ensure that you get unadulterated medicines, unless you can afford to shift to a community that already has all these things. Money may also not be able to protect you from infectious diseases, unless the whole of your community takes preventive steps.\n\nActually for many of the important things in life the best way, also the cheapest way, is to provide these goods and services collectively. Just think - will it be cheaper to have collective security for the whole locality or for each house to have its own security staff? What if no one, other than you, in your village or locality is interested in studying? Would you be able to study? Not unless your parents could afford to send you to some private school elsewhere. So you are actually able to study because many other children also want to study and because many people believe that the government should open schools and provide other facilities so that all children have a chance to study. Even now, in many areas, children, particularly girls, are not able to go to high school because the government/society has not provided adequate facilities.",

Similarly, in some states, the Public Distribution\n\nSystem (PDS) functions well. Health and nutritional status of people of such states is certainly likely to be better.\n\n# LET'S WORK THESE OUT \n\n1. Look at data in Tables 1.3 and 1.4. Is Haryana ahead of Kerala in literacy rate etc., as it is in terms of per capita income?\n2. Think of other examples where collective provision of goods and services is cheaper than individual provision.\n3. Does availability of good health and educational facilities depend only on amount of money spent by the government on these facilities? What other factors could be relevant?\n4. In a study, it was found that in Tamil Nadu, 90 per cent of the people living in rural areas used a ration shop, whereas in West Bengal only 35 per cent of rural people did so. Where would people did better off and why?\n\n\n**[IMAGE: A photo depicting a rural setting with a cow and a closed shop.]**\n\n\n\n## ACTIVITY 2\n\nStudy Table 1.5 carefully and fill in the blanks in the following paragraphs.

Therefore, illiteracy among children in the age group 1014 is as high as $\\qquad$ $\\%$ for rural females and $\\qquad$ $\\%$ for rural males.\n(c) This high level of illiteracy among $\\qquad$ age group, even after more than 75 years of our independence, is most disturbing.

      "content": "## ACTIVITY 3\n\nOne way to find out if we are properly nourished is to calculate what nutrition scientists call Body Mass Index (BMI). This is easy to calculate. Let each student in the class find out his or her weight and height. Take the weight of each student in kilograms ( kg ). Then, take the height by drawing up a scale on the wall and measuring accurately with the head straight. Convert the height recorded in centimeters into meters. Divide the weight in kg by the square of the height. The number you get is called BMI. Then, look at the BMI-for-Age tables given on pages 90-91. A student's BMI could be within the normal range or less than that (underweight) or more (obesity). For example, if a girl student is 14 years and 8 month old and the BMI is 15.2 , then she is undernourished. Similarly, if the BMI of a boy aged 15 years and 6 months is 28 , then he is overweight. Discuss the life situation, food and exercise habits of students, in general, without body shaming anyone.\n\n\n**[IMAGE: A diagram showing a health worker measuring the height of a woman.]**\n\n\n\n## HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT\n\nOnce it is realised that even though the level of income is important, yet it is an inadequate measure of the level of development, we begin to think of other criterion. There could be a long list of such criterion but then it would not be so useful. What we need is a small number of the most important things. Health and education indicators, such as the ones we used in comparison of Kerala and Haryana, are among them. Over the past decade or so, health and education indicators have come to be widely used along with income as a measure of development. For instance, Human Development Report published by UNDP compares countries based on the educational levels of the people, their health status and per capita income. It would be interesting to look at certain relevant data regarding India and its neighbours from Human Development Report 2023-24.\n\n# TABLE 1.6 SOME DATA REGARDING INDIA AND ITS NEIGHBOURS FOR 2022 \n\n| Country | Gross National <br> Income (GNI) <br> per capita <br> (2017 PPP \\$) | Life <br> Expectancy <br> at birth | Mean Years of <br> Schooling of <br> People aged 25 <br> and above | HDI Rank in <br> the world <br> (2021-22) |\n| :-- | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| Sri Lanka | 11,899 | 76.6 | 11.2 | 78 |\n| India | $\\mathbf{6 , 9 5 1}$ | $\\mathbf{6 7 . 7}$ | $\\mathbf{6 . 5}$ | $\\mathbf{1 3 4}$ |\n| Myanmar | 4,038 | 67.3 | 6.5 | 144 |\n| Pakistan | 5,374 | 66.4 | 4.4 | 164 |\n| Nepal | 4,026 | 70.5 | 4.5 | 146 |\n| Bangladesh | 6,511 | 73.7 | 7.4 | 129 |\n\nSource : Human Development Report, 2023-24, United Nations Development Programme, New York.\n\n## NOTES\n\n1. HDI stands for Human Development Index. HDI ranks in above table are out of 193 countries in all.\n2. Life Expectancy at birth denotes, as the name suggests, average expected length of life of a person at the time of birth.\n3.

It is also done in a way so that every dollar would buy the same amount of goods and services in any country.",

We would certainly like this level of development to go up further or at least be maintained for future generations. This is obviously desirable. However, since the second half of the twentieth century, a number of scientists have been warning that the present type, and levels, of development are not sustainable.\n\"We have not inherited the world from our forefathers - we have borrowed it from our children.\"\n\n## Example 1: Groundwater in India\n\n\"Recent evidence suggests that the groundwater is under serious threat of overuse in many parts of the country. About 300 districts have reported a water level decline of over 4 metres during the past 20 years. Nearly one-third of the country is overusing their groundwater reserves. In another 25 years, 60 per cent of the country would be doing the same if the present way of using this resource continues. Groundwater overuse is particularly found in the agriculturally prosperous regions of Punjab and Western U.P., hard rock plateau areas of central and south India, some coastal areas and the rapidly growing urban settlements.\"\n(a) Why groundwater is overused?\n(b) Can there be development without overuse?",

      "content": "Groundwater is an example of renewable resources. These resources are replenished by nature as in the case of crops and plants. However, even these resources may be overused. For example, in the case of groundwater, if we use more than what is being replenished by rain then we would be overusing this resource.\n\nNon-renewable resources are those which will get exhausted after a few years of use. We have a fixed stock on earth which cannot be replenished. We do discover new resources that we did not know of earlier. New sources in this way add to the stock. However, over time, even this will get exhausted.\n\nFOR EXAMPLE, CRUDE OIL THAT WE EXTRACT FROM THE EARTH IS A NONRENEWABLE RESOURCE. HOWEVER WE MAY FIND A SOURCE OF OIL THAT WE DID NOT KNOW OF EARLIER, EXPLORATIONS ARE BEING UNDERTAKEN ALL THE TIME.\n\n# Example 2: Exhaustion of Natural Resources \n\nLook at the following data for crude oil.\n\n## TABLE 1.7 CRUDE OIL RESERVES\n\n| Region/Country | Reserves (2017) <br> (Thousand Million Barrels) | Number of Years <br> Reserves will last |\n| :-- | :--: | :--: |\n| Middle East | 836 | 70 |\n| United States of America | 69 | 10.5 |\n| World | 1732 | 47 |\n\nSource : Energy Institute's Statistical Review of World Energy, 2024.\nThe table gives an estimate of reserves of crude oil (column1). More important, it also tells us for how many years the stock of crude oil will last if people continue to extract it at the present rate. The reserves would last only 50 years more. This is for the world as a whole. However, different countries face different situations. Countries like India depend on importing oil from abroad because they do not have enough stocks of their own. If prices of oil increase this becomes a burden for everyone. There are countries like USA which have low reserves and hence want to secure oil through military or economic power.\n\nThe question of sustainability of development raises many fundamentally new issues about the nature and process of development.\n(a) Is crude oil essential for the development process in a country? Discuss.\n(b) India has to import crude oil. What problems do you anticipate for the country looking at the above situation?",

Sustainability of development is comparatively a new area of knowledge in which scientists, economists, philosophers and other\nsocial scientists are working together.\n\nIn general, the question of development or progress is perennial. At all times as a member of society and as individuals we need to ask where we want to go, what we wish to become and what our goals are. So the debate on development continues.\n\n# EXERCISES \n\n1.

      "content": "# NOTES FOR THE TEACHER \n\n## CHAPTER 2: SECTORS OF THE INDIAN ECONOMY\n\nAn economy is best understood when we study its components or sectors. Sectoral classification can be done on the basis of several criteria. In this chapter, three types of classifications are discussed: primary/secondary/tertiary; organised/ unorganised; and public/private. You can create a discussion about these types by taking examples familiar to the students and relate them to their daily life. It is important to emphasise the changing roles of sectors. This can be highlighted further by drawing attention of the students to the rapid growth of service sector. While elaborating the ideas provided in the chapter, the students may need to be familiarised with a few fundamental concepts such as Gross Domestic Product, Employment etc. Since the students may find this difficult to understand, it is necessary to explain to them through examples. Several activities and exercises are suggested in the chapter to help the students understand how a person's activity could be placed whether in the primary, secondary or tertiary, organised or unorganised, and public or private sector. You may encourage the students to talk to various working people around them (such as shop owners, casual workers, vegetable vendors, workshop mechanics, domestic workers etc.) to know more about how they live and work. Based on such information, the students can be encouraged to develop their own classification of economic activities.\n\nAnother important issue to be highlighted is about the problems caused by the changes in the roles of sectors. The chapter has taken the example of unemployment and what the government can do to solve it. The declining importance of agriculture and growing importance of\nindustry and services should be related to the experience of the children by taking more examples that they may observe in their day-to-day life. Information derived from the media could be used for this purpose. You may encourage the students to bring important cuttings and stories from newspapers, which could be prominently displayed in storyboards, and encourage the class to discuss these issues. While discussing the unorganised sector, the key issue of protecting the workers engaged in the sector should be highlighted. You may also encourage the students to visit persons and enterprises in the unorganised sector and get a first hand experience from real life situation.\n\n## Sources for Information\n\nThe GVA data used in this chapter pertaining to Real Gross Value Added at Basic Prices by Industry of Origin at 2011-12 prices is taken from Economic Survey. It is a valuable source of GVA and other information relating to the Indian economy. For evaluation purposes, particularly to develop the analytical ability of learners, teachers can refer to this report through the Internet to get data for different years. Due to change in methodology, latest data is not used in the chapter.\n\nThe employment figures are based on data taken from the five-yearly surveys on employment and unemployment conducted by the National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO) now known as National Statistical Office (NSO). NSO is an organisation under the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation, Government of India. The website you can log onto is: http:/mospi.gov.in. Employment data is also available from other sources such as Census of India.",

      "content": "We begin by looking at different kind of economic activities.\n\nThere are many activities that are undertaken by directly using natural resources. Take, for example, the cultivation of cotton. It takes place within a crop season. For the growth of the cotton plant, we depend mainly, but not entirely, on natural factors like rainfall, sunshine and climate. The product of this activity, cotton, is a natural product. Similarly, in the case of an activity like dairy, we are dependent on the biological process of the animals and availability of fodder etc. The product here, milk, also is a natural product. Similarly, minerals and ores are also natural products. When we produce a good by exploiting natural resources, it is an activity of the primary sector. Why primary? This is because it forms the base for all other products that we subsequently make. Since most of the natural products we get are from agriculture, dairy, fishing, forestry, this sector is also called agriculture and related sector.\n\nThe secondary sector covers activities in which natural products are changed into other forms through ways of manufacturing that we associate with industrial activity. It is the next step after primary. The product is not produced by nature but has to be made and therefore some process of manufacturing is essential. This could be in a factory, a workshop or at home. For example, using cotton fibre from the plant, we\nspin yarn and weave cloth. Using sugarcane as a raw material, we make sugar or gur. We convert earth into bricks and use bricks to make houses and buildings. Since this sector gradually became associated with the different kinds of industries that came up, it is also called as industrial sector.\n\nAfter primary and secondary, there is a third category of activities that falls under tertiary sector and is different from the above two. These are activities that help in the development of the primary and secondary sectors. These activities, by themselves, do not produce a good but they are an aid or a support for the production process. For example, goods that are produced in the primary or secondary sector would need to be transported by trucks or trains and then sold in wholesale and retail shops. At times, it may be necessary to store these in godowns. We also may need to talk to others over telephone or send letters (communication) or borrow money from banks (banking) to help production and trade. Transport, storage, communication, banking, trade are some examples of tertiary activities. Since these activities generate services rather than goods, the tertiary sector is also called the service sector.\n\nService sector also includes some essential services that may not directly help in the production of goods. For example, we require teachers, doctors, and those who provide personal services such as washermen, barbers, cobblers, lawyers, and people to do administrative and accounting works. In recent times, certain new services based on information technology such as internet cafe, ATM booths, call centres, software companies etc have become important.",

The mill will have to shut down.\nImagine what would happen to cotton cultivation if companies decide not to buy from the Indian market and import all cotton they need from other countries. Indian cotton cultivation will become less profitable and the farmers may even go bankrupt, if they cannot quickly switch to other crops. Cotton prices will fall.\nFarmers buy many goods such as tractors, pumpsets, electricity, pesticides and fertilisers. Imagine what would happen if the price of fertilisers or pumpsets go up. Cost of cultivation of the farmers will rise and their profits will be reduced.\nPeople working in industrial and service sectors need food. Imagine what would happen if there is a strike by transporters and lorries refuse to take vegetables, milk, etc. from rural areas. Food will become scarce in urban areas whereas farmers will be unable to sell their products.\n\n## WHAT DOES THIS SHOW?\n\nThis is an example of the secondary or industrial sector being dependent on the primary.\n\n\n**[IMAGE: Text discussing the impact of price changes and strikes on farmers and food supply.]**\n\n\n\n## LET'S WORK THESE OUT\n\n1.

      "content": "# COMPARING THE THREE SECTORS \n\nThe various production activities in the primary, secondary and tertiary sectors produce a very large number of goods and services. Also, the three sectors have a large number of people working in them to produce these goods and services. The next step, therefore, is to see how much goods and services are produced and how many people work in each sector. In an economy there could be one or more sectors which are dominant in terms of total production and employment, while other sectors are relatively small in size.\n\n## How do we count the various goods and services and know the total production in each sector?\n\nWith so many thousands of goods and services produced, you might think this is an impossible task! Not only would the task be enormous, you might also wonder how we can add up cars and computers and nails and furniture. It won't make sense!!!\n\nYou are right in thinking so. To get around this problem, economists suggest that the values of goods and services should be used rather than adding up the actual numbers. For example, if $10,000 \\mathrm{kgs}$ of wheat is sold at Rs 20 per kg , the value of wheat will be Rs $2,00,000$. The value of 5000 coconuts at Rs 15 per coconut will be Rs 75,000 . Similarly, the value of goods and services in the three sectors are calculated, and then added up.\n\nRemember, there is one precaution one has to take. Not every good (or service) that is produced and sold needs to be counted. It makes sense only to include the final goods and services. Take, for instance, a farmer who sells wheat to a flour mill for Rs 20 per kg . The mill grinds the wheat and sells the flour to a biscuit company for Rs 25 per kg. The biscuit company uses the flour and things such as sugar and oil to make four packets of biscuits. It sells biscuits in the market to the consumers for Rs 80 (Rs 20 per packet). Biscuits are the final goods, i.e., goods that reach the consumers.\n\nWhy are only 'final goods and services' counted? In contrast to final goods, goods such as wheat and the wheat flour in this example are intermediate goods. Intermediate goods are used up in producing final goods and services. The value of final goods already includes the value of all the intermediate goods that are used in making the final good. Hence, the value of Rs 80 for the biscuits (final good) already includes the value of flour (Rs 25). Similarly, the value of all other intermediate goods would have been included. To count the value of the flour and wheat separately is therefore not correct because then we would be counting the value of the same things a number of times. First as wheat, then as flour and finally as biscuits.",

      "content": "The value of final goods and services produced in each sector during a particular year provides the total production of the sector for that year. And the sum of production in the different sectors gives what is called the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of a country. It is the value of all final goods and services produced within a country during a particular year. GDP shows how big the economy is.\n\nIn India, the mammoth task of measuring GDP is undertaken by a central government ministry. This Ministry, with the help of various government departments of all the Indian states and union territories, collects information relating to total volume of goods and services and their prices and then estimates the GDP.\n\nRecently Indian Government began to bring out the contribution of three sectors towards Gross Value Added (GVA) in place of the contribution of three sectors towards Gross Domestic Product to be at par with global practices. The GVA measures the contribution of three sectors of an economy after adjusting for taxes and subsidies. You will learn more about the GVA and the difference between GDP and GVA in higher classes. Here we will only understand how goods and services produced in these three sectors-primary, secondary and tertiary sectors have changed.\n\n## Historical Change in Sectors\n\nGenerally, it has been noted from the histories of many, now developed, countries that at initial stages of development, primary sector was the most important sector of economic activity.\n\nAs the methods of farming changed and agriculture sector began to prosper, it produced much more food than before. Many people could now take up other activities. There were increasing number of craft-persons and traders. Buying and selling activities increased many times.\n\nBesides, there were also transporters, administrators, army etc. However, at this stage, most of the goods produced were natural products from the primary sector and most people were also employed in this sector.\n\nOver a long time (more than hundred years), and especially because new methods of manufacturing were introduced, factories came up and started expanding. Those people who had earlier worked on farms now began to work in factories in large numbers. They were forced to do so as you read in history chapters. People began to use many more goods that were produced in factories at cheap rates. Secondary sector gradually became the most important in total production and employment. Hence, over time, a shift had taken place. This means that the importance of the sectors had changed.\n\nIn the past 100 years, there has been a further shift from secondary to tertiary sector in developed countries. The service sector has become the most important in terms of total production. Most of the working people are also employed in the service sector. This is the general pattern observed in developed countries.\n\nWhat is the total production and employment in the three sectors in India? Over the years have there been changes similar to the pattern observed for the developed countries? We shall see in the next section.\n\n## LET'S WORK THESE OUT\n\n1. What does the history of developed countries indicate about the shifts that have taken place between sectors?\n2. Correct and arrange the important aspects for calculating GDP from this Jumble.\n\nTo count goods and services we add the numbers that are produced. We count all those that were produced in the last five years. Since we shouldn't leave out anything we add up all these goods and services.\n3. Discuss with your teacher how you could calculate the total value of a good or service by using the method of value added at each stage.",

We have used the data for these two years because the data are comparable and authentic. You can see how the total production has grown over the forty years.\n\n## LET'S WORK THESE OUT\n\nAnswer the following questions by looking at the graph:\n\n1. Which was the largest producing sector in 1977-78?\n2. Which is the largest producing sector in 2017-18?\n3. Can you say which sector has grown the most over forty years?\n4.

What conclusions can we draw from the comparison?\n\nLet's find out.\n\n## Rising Importance of the Tertiary Sector in Production\n\nOver the forty years between 1977-78 and 2017-18, while production in all the three sectors has increased, it has increased the most in the tertiary sector. As a result, in the year 2017-18, the tertiary sector has emerged as the largest producing sector in India replacing the primary sector.\n\nWhy is the tertiary sector becoming so important in India? There could be several reasons.\n\nFirst, in any country several services such as hospitals, educational institutions, post and telegraph services, police stations, courts, village administrative offices, municipal corporations, defence, transport, banks, insurance companies, etc. are required. These can be considered as basic services. In a developing country the government has to take responsibility for the provision of these services.\n\nSecond, the development of agriculture and industry leads to the development of services such as",

Greater the development of the primary and secondary sectors, more would be the demand for such services.\n\nThird, as income levels rise, certain sections of people start demanding many more services like eating out, tourism, shopping, private hospitals, private schools, professional training etc. You can see this change quite sharply in cities, especially in big cities.\n\nFourth, over the past decade or so, certain new services such as those based on information and communication technology have become important and essential. The production of these services has been rising rapidly. In Chapter 4, we shall see examples of these new services and the reasons for their expansion.\n\nHowever, you must remember that not all of the service sector is growing equally well. Service sector in India employs many different kinds of people. At one end there are a limited number of services that employ highly skilled and educated workers. At the other end, there are a very large number of workers engaged in services such as small shopkeepers, repair persons, transport persons, etc. These people barely manage to earn a living and yet they perform these services because no alternative opportunities for work are available to them. Hence, only a part of this sector is growing in importance. You shall read more about this in the next section.\n\n## Where are most of the people employed?\n\nGraph 2 presents percentage share of the three sectors in GVA. Now you can directly see the changing importance of the sectors over the forty years.\n\n\n**[IMAGE: A bar chart showing the share of different sectors in Gross Value Added (GVA) for the years 1977-78 and 2017-18.]**\n\n\n\nA remarkable fact about India is that while there has been a change in the share of the three sectors in GVA, a similar shift has not taken place in employment. Graph 3 shows the share of employment in the three sectors in 1977-78 and 2017-18. The primary sector continues to be the largest employer even now.\n\n\n**[IMAGE: A bar chart showing the share of sectors in employment for the years 1977-78 and 2017-18.]**\n\n\n\nWhy didn't a similar shift out of primary sector happen in case of employment? It is because not enough jobs were created in the secondary and tertiary sectors. Even",

      "content": "though industrial output or the production of goods went up by more than nine times during the period, employment in the industry went up by around three times. The same applies to the tertiary sector as well. While production in the service sector rose by 14 times, employment in the service sector rose around five times.\n\nAs a result, more than half of the workers in the country are working in the primary sector, mainly in agriculture, producing only about one sixth of the GVA. In contrast to this, the secondary and tertiary sectors produce the rest of the produce whereas they employ less about half the people. Does this mean that the workers in agriculture are not producing as much as they could?\n\nWhat it means is that there are more people in agriculture than is necessary. So, even if you move a few people out, production will not be affected. In other words, workers in the agricultural sector are underemployed.\n\nFor instance, take the case of a small farmer, Laxmi, owning about two hectares of unirrigated land dependent only on rain and growing crops, like jowar and arhar. All five members of her family work in the plot throughout the year. Why? They have nowhere else to go for work. You will see that everyone is working, none remains idle, but in actual fact, their labour effort gets divided. Each one is doing some work but no one is fully employed. This is the situation of underemployment, where people are apparently working but all of them are made to work less than their potential. This kind of\n\n\n**[IMAGE: An illustration of an ancient Indian woman with traditional attire and jewelry.]**\n\n\nunderemployment is hidden in contrast to someone who does not have a job and is clearly visible as unemployed. Hence, it is also called disguised unemployment.\n\nNow, supposing a landlord, Sukhram, comes and hires one or two members of the family to work on his land. Laxmi's family is now able to earn some extra income through wages. Since you do not need five people to look after that small plot, two people moving out does not affect production on their farm. In the above example, two people may move to work in a factory. Once again the earnings of the family would increase and they would also continue to produce as much from their land.\n\nThere are lakhs of farmers like Laxmi in India. This means that even if we remove a lot of people from agricultural sector and provide them with proper work elsewhere, agricultural production will not suffer. The incomes of the people who take up other work would increase the total family income.\n\nThis underemployment can also happen in other sectors. For example there are thousands of casual workers in the service sector in urban areas who search for daily employment. They are employed as painters, plumbers, repair persons and others doing odd jobs. Many of them don't find work everyday. Similarly, we see other people of the service sector on the street pushing a cart or selling something where they may spend the whole day but earn very little. They are doing this work because they do not have better opportunities.",

This could lead to a lot of employment generation within the agricultural sector itself reducing the problem of underemployment.\n\nNow, suppose Laxmi and other farmers produce much more than before. They would also need to sell some of this. For this they may be required to transport their products to a nearby town. If the government invests some money in transportation and storage of crops, or makes better rural roads so that mini-trucks reach everywhere several farmers like Laxmi, who now have access to water, can continue to grow and sell these crops. This activity can provide productive employment to not just farmers but also others such as those in services like transport or trade.\n\nLaxmi's need is not confined to water alone. To cultivate the land, she also needs seeds, fertilisers, agricultural equipment and pumpsets to draw water. Being a poor farmer, she cannot afford many of these.

If the local bank gives her credit at a reasonable rate of interest, she will be able to buy all these in time and cultivate her land. This means that along with water, we also need to provide cheap agricultural credit to the farmers for farming to improve. We will look at some of these needs in Chapter 3, Money and Credit.\n\nAnother way by which we can tackle this problem is to identify, promote and locate industries and services in semi-rural areas where a large number of people may be employed. For instance, suppose many farmers decide to grow arhar and chickpea (pulse crops). Setting up a dal mill to procure and process these and sell in the cities is one such example. Opening a cold storage could give an opportunity for farmers to store their products like potatoes and onions and sell them when the price is good. In villages near forest areas, we can start honey collection centres where farmers can come and sell wild honey. It is also possible to set up industries that process vegetables and agricultural produce like potato, sweet potato, rice, wheat, tomato, fruits, which can be sold in outside markets. This will provide employment in industries located in semi-rural areas and not necessarily in large urban centres.\n\nWhat groups of people do you think are unemployed or underemployed in your area? Can you think of some measures that could be taken up for them?\n\nDo you know that in India about 60 per cent of the population belongs to the age group 5-29 years? Out of this, only about 51 per cent are attending educational institutions. The rest and particularly those aged less than 18 years may be at home or",

      "content": "## How to Protect Workers in the Unorganised Sector?\n\nThe organised sector offers jobs that are the most sought-after. But the employment opportunities in the organised sector have been expanding very slowly. It is also common to find many organised sector enterprises in the unorganised sector. They adopt such strategies to evade taxes and refuse to follow laws that protect labourers. As a result, a large number of workers are forced to enter the unorganised sector jobs, which pay a very low salary. They are often exploited and not paid a fair wage. Their earnings are low and not regular. These jobs are not secure and have no other benefits.\n\nSince the 1990s, it is also common to see a large number of workers losing their jobs in the organised sector. These workers are forced to take up jobs in the unorganised sector with low earnings. Hence, besides the need for more work, there is also a need for protection and support of the workers in the unorganised sector.\n\nWho are these vulnerable people who need protection? In the rural areas, the unorganised sector mostly comprises of landless agricultural labourers, small and marginal farmers, sharecroppers and artisans (such as weavers, blacksmiths, carpenters and goldsmiths). Nearly 80 per cent of rural households in India are in small and marginal farmer category. These farmers need to be supported through adequate facility for timely delivery of seeds, agricultural inputs, credit, storage facilities and marketing outlets.\n\nIn the urban areas, unorganised sector comprises mainly of workers in small-scale industry, casual workers in construction, trade and transport etc., and those who work as street vendors, head load workers, garment makers, rag pickers etc. Small-scale industry also needs government's support for procuring raw material and marketing of output. The casual workers in both rural and urban areas need to be protected.\n\nWe also find that majority of workers from scheduled castes, tribes and backward communities find themselves in the unorganised sector. Besides getting the irregular and low paid work, these workers also face social discrimination. Protection and support to the unorganised sector workers is thus necessary for both economic and social development.\n\nWhen factories close down, many once regular workers are found selling goods or pushing a cart or doing some other odd job",

      "content": "# LET'S RECALL \n\nWith so many activities taking place around us, one needs to use the process of classification to think in a useful manner. The criterion for classification could be many depending on what we desire to find out. The process of classification helps to analyse a situation.\nIn dividing the economic activities into three sectors - primary, secondary, tertiary - the criterion used was the 'nature of activity'. On the basis of this classification, we were able to analyse the pattern of total production and employment in India. Similarly, we divided the economic activities into organised and unorganised and used the classification to look at employment in the two sectors.\n\nWhat was the most important conclusion that was derived from the classification exercises? What were the problems and solutions that were indicated? Can you summarise the information in the following table?\n\n## TABLE 2.4 CLASSIFYING ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES\n\n| Sector | Criteria used | Most important <br> conclusion | Problems indicated and <br> how they can be tackled |\n| :-- | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| Primary, <br> Secondary, <br> Tertiary | Nature <br> of activity |  |  |\n| Organised, <br> Unorganised |  |  |  |\n\n## SECTORS IN TERMS OF OWNERSHIP: PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS\n\nAnother way of classifying economic activities into sectors could be on the basis of who owns assets and is responsible for the delivery of services. In the public sector, the government owns most of the assets and provides all the services. In the private sector, ownership of assets and delivery of services is in the hands of private individuals or companies. Railways or post office is an example of the public sector whereas companies like Tata Iron and Steel Company Limited (TISCO) or Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) are privately owned.\n\nActivities in the private sector are guided by the motive to earn profits.\n\nTo get such services we have to pay money to these individuals and companies. The purpose of the public sector is not just to earn profits. Governments raise money through taxes and other ways to meet expenses on the services rendered by it. Modern day governments spend on a whole range of activities. What are these activities? Why do governments spend on such activities? Let's find out.\n\nThere are several things needed by the society as a whole but which the private sector will not provide at a reasonable cost. Why? Some of these need spending large sums of money, which is beyond the capacity",

Even if they do provide these things they would charge a high rate for their use. Examples are construction of roads, bridges, railways, harbours, generating electricity, providing irrigation through dams etc. Thus, governments have to undertake such heavy spending and ensure that these facilities are available for everyone.\n\nThere are some activities, which the government has to support. The private sector may not continue their production or business unless government encourages it. For example, selling electricity at the cost of generation may push up the costs of production of goods in many industries. Many units, especially small-scale units, might have to shut down. Government here steps in by producing and supplying electricity at rates which these industries can afford. Government has to bear part of the cost.\n\nSimilarly, the Government in India buys wheat and rice from farmers at a 'fair price'. This it stores in its godowns and sells at a lower price to consumers through ration shops. You have read about this in the chapter on Food Security in Class IX. The\ngovernment has to bear some of the cost. In this way, the government supports both farmers and consumers.\n\nThere are a large number of activities which are the primary responsibility of the government. The government must spend on these. Providing health and education facilities for all is one example. We have discussed some of these issues in the first chapter. Running proper schools and providing quality education, particularly elementary education, is the duty of the government. Indias size of illiterate population is one of the largest in the world.\n\nSimilarly, we know that nearly half of Indias children are malnourished and a quarter of them are critically ill. We have read about Infant Mortality Rates. The infant mortality rate of Odisha (36) or Madhya Pradesh (43) is higher than some of the poorest regions of the world. Government also needs to pay attention to aspects of human development such as availability of safe drinking water, housing facilities for the poor and food and nutrition. It is also the duty of the government to take care of the poorest and most ignored regions of the country through increased spending in such areas.\n\n# SUMIMING UP \n\nIn this chapter we have looked at ways of classifying economic activities into some meaningful groups. One way of doing this is to examine whether the activity relates to the primary, secondary or tertiary sectors. The data for India, for the last thirty years, shows that while goods and services produced in the tertiary sector contribute the most to GDP, the employment remains in the primary sector. We have also seen\nwhat all can be done for increasing employment opportunities in the country. Another classification is to consider whether people are working in organised or unorganised sectors. Most people are working in the unorganised sectors and protection is necessary for them. We also looked at the difference between private and public activities, and why it is important for public activities to focus on certain areas.",

      "content": "# NOTES FOR THE TEACHER \n\n## CHAPTER 3 : MONEY AND CREDIT\n\nMoney is a fascinating subject and full of curiosities. It is important to capture this element for the students. The history of money and how various forms were used at different times is an interesting story. At this stage the purpose is to allow students to realise the social situation in which these forms were used. Modern forms of money are linked to the banking system. This is the central idea of the first part of the chapter.\n\nThe present situation in India, where newer forms of money are slowly spreading with computerisation of the banking system, offers many opportunities to students to explore on their own. We need not get into a formal discussion of the 'functions of money' but let it come up as questions. There are certain areas that are not covered, such as 'creation of money' (money multiplier) or the backing of the modern system that may be discussed if you desire.\n\nAs you would see in the chapter, the stock of money consists of currency held by the public and the demand deposits that they hold with the banks. This is the money that people can use as they wish and the government has to ensure that the system works smoothy. What would happen when the government declares that some of the currency notes used by people would be made invalid and would be replaced by new currency? In India, during November 2016, currency notes in the denomination of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 were declared invalid. People were asked to surrender these notes to the bank by a specific period and receive new Rs. 500, Rs. 2,000 or other currency notes. This is known as 'demonetisation'. Since then, people were also encouraged to use their bank deposits rather than cash for transactions. Hence, digital transactions started by using bank-to-bank transfer through the internet or mobile phones, cheques, ATM cards, credit cards, and Point of Sale (POS) swipe machines at shops. This is promoted to reduce the requirement of cash for transactions and also control corruption. Students could be asked to debate on the process and the impact of demonetisation. They can be guided to make\na collage of the major areas where people use digital and cash transactions which are legitimate and legal. They can also discuss the transactions which are legal and why. It is also important to intimate students that different types of plastic cards are used in place of cash transactions but not all of them money per se.\n\nCredit is a crucial element in economic life and it is, therefore, important to first understand this in a conceptual manner. What are the aspects that one looks at in any credit arrangement and how this affects people is the main focus of the second part of the chapter. The world around us offers a tremendous variety of such arrangements and it would be ideal to explain these aspects of credit from situations that are familiar to your students. The other crucial issue of credit is its availability to all, especially the poor, and on reasonable terms. We need to emphasise that this is a right of the people and without which a large section of them would be kept out of the development process. There are many innovative interventions, such as that of Grameen Bank, of which students may be made familiar with but it is important to realise that we don't have answers to all questions. We need to find new ways and this is one of the social challenges that developing countries face.\n\n## Sources for Information\n\nThe data on formal and informal sector credit used in this chapter is drawn from the survey on rural debt by the National Sample Survey Organisation (All India Debt and Investment Survey, $77^{\\text {th }}$ Round 2019, conducted by NSSO) now known as National Statistical Office (NSO). The information and data on Grameen Bank is taken from newspaper reports and websites. In order to get the details of bank-related statistics or a particular detail of a bank, you can log on to the websites of the Reserve Bank of India (www.rbi.org) and the concerned banks. Data on self-help groups is provided on the website of the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) (www.nabard.org).",

Look around you and you would easily be able to identify several transactions involving money in any single day. Can you make a list of these? In many of these transactions, goods are being bought and sold with the use of money. In some of these transactions, services are being exchanged with money. For some, there might not be any actual transfer of money taking place now but a promise to pay money later.\n\nHave you ever wondered why transactions are made in money? The reason is simple.\nA person holding money can easily exchange it for any commodity or service that he or she might want. Thus everyone prefers to receive payments in money and then exchange the money for things that they want. Take the case of a shoe manufacturer. He wants to sell shoes in the market and buy wheat. The shoe manufacturer will first exchange shoes that he has produced for money, and then exchange the money for wheat. Imagine how much more\n\n\n**[IMAGE: An illustration depicting an ancient Indian scene with a person offering shoes.]**\n\n\nonly wants to sell wheat but also wants to buy the shoes in exchange. That is, both parties have to agree to sell and buy each others commodities. This is known as double coincidence\nof wants. What a person desires to sell is exactly what the other wishes to buy. In a barter system where goods are directly exchanged without the use of money, double coincidence of wants is an essential feature.\n\nIn contrast, in an economy where money is in use, money by providing the crucial intermediate step eliminates the need for double coincidence of wants. It is no longer necessary for the shoe manufacturer to look for a farmer who will buy his shoes and at the same time sell him",

      "content": "wheat. All he has to do is find a buyer for his shoes. Once he has exchanged his shoes for money, he can purchase wheat or any other commodity in the market. Since money acts as an intermediate in the exchange process, it is called a medium of exchange.\n\n# LET'S WORK THESE OUT \n\n1. How does the use of money make it easier to exchange things?\n2. Can you think of some examples of goods / services being exchanged or wages being paid through barter?\n\nEarly punch: marked coins (may be 2500 years old)\n\n\n**[IMAGE: A collection of various types of coins from different periods in Indian history.]**\n\n\n\nModern coin\n\n## MODERN FORMS OF MONEY\n\nWe have seen that money is something that can act as a medium of exchange in transactions. Before the introduction of coins, a variety of objects was used as money. For example, since the very early ages, Indians used grains and cattle as money. Thereafter came the use of metallic coins - gold, silver, copper coins - a phase which continued well into the last century.\n\n## Currency\n\nModern forms of money include currency - paper notes and coins. Unlike the things that were used as money earlier, modern currency is not made of precious metal such as gold, silver and copper. And unlike grain and cattle, they are neither of everyday use. The modern currency is without any use of its own.\n\nThen, why is it accepted as a medium of exchange? It is accepted as a medium of exchange because the currency is authorised by the government of the country.\n\nIn India, the Reserve Bank of India issues currency notes on behalf of the central government. As per Indian law, no other individual or\norganisation is allowed to issue currency. Moreover, the law legalises the use of rupee as a medium of payment that cannot be refused in settling transactions in India. No individual in India can legally refuse a payment made in rupees. Hence, the rupee is widely accepted as a medium of exchange.\n\n## Deposits with Banks\n\nThe other form in which people hold money is as deposits with banks. At a point of time, people need only some currency for their day-to-day needs. For instance, workers who receive their salaries at the end of each month have extra cash at the beginning of the month. What do people do with this extra cash? They deposit it with the banks by opening a bank account in their name. Banks accept the deposits and also pay an amount as interest on the deposits. In this way people's money is safe with the banks and it earns an amount as interest. People also have the provision to withdraw the money as and when they require. Since the deposits in the bank accounts can be withdrawn on demand, these deposits are called demand deposits.",

For payment through cheque, the payer who has an account with the bank, makes out a cheque for a specific amount. A cheque is a paper instructing the bank to pay a specific amount from the person's account to the person in whose name the cheque has been issued.\n\n# Cheque Payments \n\nA shoe manufacturer, M. Salim has to make a payment to the leather supplier and writes a cheque for a specific amount. This means that the shoe manufacturer instructs his bank to pay this amount to the leather supplier. The leather supplier takes this cheque, and deposits it in his own account in the bank. The money is transferred from one bank account to another bank account in a couple of days. The transaction is complete without any payment of cash.\n\n\n**[IMAGE: An image of a cheque from the State Bank of India with annotations indicating the account number, bank branch code, cheque number, and coding used by banks.]**\n\n\n\nThus we see that demand deposits share the essential features of money. The facility of cheques against demand deposits makes it possible to directly settle payments without the use of cash. Since demand deposits are accepted widely as a means of payment, along with currency, they constitute money in the modern economy.\n\nYou must remember the role that the banks play here. But for the banks, there would be no demand deposits and no payments by cheques against these deposits.

Tick the correct answer.\n\nAfter the transaction between Salim and Prem,\n(i) Salim's balance in his bank account increases, and Prem's balance increases.\n(ii) Salim's balance in his bank account decreases and Prem's balance increases.\n(iii) Salim's balance in his bank account increases and Prem's balance decreases.\n3. Why are demand deposits considered as money?\n\n## LOAN ACTIVITIES OF BANKS\n\nLet us take the story of banks further. What do the banks do with the deposits which they accept from the public? There is an interesting mechanism at work here. Banks keep only a small proportion of their deposits as cash with themselves. For example, banks in India these days hold about 5 per cent of their deposits as cash. This is kept as provision to pay the depositors who might come to withdraw money from the bank on any given day. Since, on any particular day, only some of its many depositors come to withdraw cash, the bank is able to manage with this cash.\n\nBanks use the major portion of the deposits to extend loans. There is a\nhuge demand for loans for various economic activities. We shall read more about this in the following sections. Banks make use of the deposits to meet the loan requirements of the people. In this way, banks mediate between those who have surplus funds (the depositors) and those who are in need of these funds (the borrowers). Banks charge a higher interest rate on loans than what they offer on deposits. The difference between what is charged from borrowers and what is paid to depositors is their main source of income.\n\nWhat do you think would happen if all the depositors went to ask for their money at the same time?\n\n\n**[IMAGE: A diagram illustrating the basic functioning of a bank, showing the interaction between depositors and borrowers.]**\n\n",

      "content": "# TWO DIFFERENT CREDIT SITUATIONS \n\nA large number of transactions in our day-to-day activities involve credit in some form or the other. Credit (loan) refers to an agreement in which the lender supplies the borrower with money, goods or services in return for the promise of future payment. Let us see how credit works through the following two examples.\n\n## (1) Festival Season\n\nIt is festival season two months from now and the shoe manufacturer, Salim, has received an order from a large trader in town for 3,000 pairs of shoes to be delivered in a month time. To complete production on time, Salim has to hire a few more workers for stitching and pasting work. He has to purchase the raw materials. To meet these expenses, Salim obtains loans from two sources. First, he asks the leather supplier to supply leather\nnow and promises to pay him later. Second, he obtains loan in cash from the large trader as advance payment for 1000 pairs of shoes with a promise to deliver the whole order by the end of the month.\n\nAt the end of the month, Salim is able to deliver the order, make a good profit, and repay the money that he had borrowed.\n\nIn this case, Salim obtains credit to meet the working capital needs of production. The credit helps him to meet the ongoing expenses of production, complete production on time, and thereby increase his earnings. Credit therefore plays a vital and positive role in this situation.\n\n## (2) Swapna's Problem\n\nSwapna, a small farmer, grows groundnut on her three acres of land. She takes a loan from the moneylender to meet the expenses of cultivation, hoping that her harvest would help repay the loan. Midway through the season the crop is hit by pests and the crop fails. Though Swapna sprays her crops with expensive pesticides, it makes little difference. She is unable to repay the moneylender and the debt grows over the year into a large amount. Next year, Swapna takes a fresh loan for cultivation. It is a normal crop this year. But the earnings are not enough to cover the old loan. She is caught in debt. She has to sell a part of the land to pay off the debt.\n\n\n**[IMAGE: An illustration of a woman tending to a plant, possibly depicting themes of rural life and agricultural struggles.]**\n\n",

      "content": "In rural areas, the main demand for credit is for crop production. Crop production involves considerable costs on seeds, fertilisers, pesticides, water, electricity, repair of equipment, etc. There is a minimum stretch of three to four months between the time when the farmers buy these inputs and when they sell the crop. Farmers usually take crop loans at the beginning of the season and repay the loan after harvest. Repayment of the loan is crucially dependent on the income from farming.\n\n## LET'S WORK THESE OUT\n\n1. Fill the following table.\n\n|  | Salim | Swapna |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| Why did they need credit? |  |  |\n| What was the risk? |  |  |\n| What was the outcome? |  |  |\n\n2. Supposing Salim continues to get orders from traders. What would be his position after 6 years?\n3. What are the reasons that make Swapna's situation so risky? Discuss factors - pesticides; role of moneylenders; climate.\n\nIn Swapna's case, the failure of the crop made loan repayment impossible. She had to sell part of the land to repay the loan. Credit, instead of helping Swapna improve her earnings, left her worse off. This is an example of what is commonly called debt-trap. Credit in this case pushes the borrower into a situation from which recovery is very painful.\n\nIn one situation credit helps to increase earnings and therefore the person is better off than before. In another situation, because of the crop failure, credit pushes the person into a debt trap. To repay her loan she has to sell a portion of her land. She is clearly much worse off than before. Whether credit would be useful or not, therefore, depends on the risks in the situation and whether there is some support, in case of loss.\n\n# TERMS OF CREDIT \n\nEvery loan agreement specifies an interest rate which the borrower must pay to the lender along with the\n\n\n**[IMAGE: A woman in traditional attire walking past a banner advertising personal loans from Centurion Bank of Punjab.]**\n\n\nrepayment of the principal. In addition, lenders may demand collateral (security) against loans. Collateral is an asset that the borrower owns (such as land, building, vehicle, livestocks, deposits with banks) and uses this as a guarantee to a lender until the loan is repaid. If the borrower fails to repay the loan, the lender has the right to sell the asset or collateral to obtain payment. Property such as land titles, deposits with banks, livestock are some common examples of collateral used for borrowing.",

Read what they record...\n\n\n**[IMAGE: Diagram of a plant showing its root system and leaves.]**\n\n\n\n15th Nov, 2019.\nWe head directly for the fields where most farmers and labourers would be working at this time of the day. The fields are planted with potato crops. We first meet Shyamal, a small farmer in Sonpur, a small irrigated village.\n\nShyamal tells us that every season he needs loans for cultivation on his 1.5 acres of land. Till a few years back, he would borrow money from the village moneylender at an interest rate of five per cent per month ( $60 \\%$ per annum). For the last few years, Shyamal has been borrowing from an agricultural trader in the village at an interest rate of three per cent per month. At the beginning of the cropping season, the trader supplies the farm inputs on credit, which is to be repaid when the crops are ready for harvest.\n\nBesides the interest charge on the loan, the trader also makes the farmers promise to sell the crop to him. This way the trader can ensure that the money is repaid promptly. Also, since the crop prices are low after the harvest, the trader is able to make a profit from buying the crop at a low price from the farmers and then selling it later when the price has risen.\n\n\n**[IMAGE: Two women are seen harvesting potatoes in a field.]**\n\n\n\nWe next meet Arun who is supervising the work of one farm labourer. Arun has seven acres of land. He is one of the few persons in Sonpur to receive bank loan for cultivation. The interest rate on the loan is 8.5 per cent per annum, and can be repaid anytime in the next three years. Arun plans to repay the loan after harvest by selling a part of the crop. He then intends to store the rest of the potatoes in a cold storage and apply for a fresh loan from the bank against the cold storage receipt. The bank offers this facility to farmers who have taken crop loan from them.\n\nRama is working in a neighbouring field. She works as an agricultural labourer. There are several months in the year when Rama has no work, and needs credit to meet the daily expenses. Expenses on sudden illnesses or functions in the family are also met through loans. Rama has to depend on her employer, a medium landowner in Sonpur, for credit. The landowner charges an interest rate of 5 per cent per month. Rama repays the money by working for the landowner. Most of the time, Rama has to take a fresh loan, before the previous loan has been repaid. At present, she owes the landowner Rs 5,000. Though the landowner doesn't treat her well, she continues to work for him since she can get loans from him when in need. Rama tells us that the only source of credit for the landless people in Sonpur are the landowner-employers.",

There is no one to stop them from using unfair means to get their money back.\n\nCompared to the formal lenders, most of the informal lenders charge a much higher interest on loans. Thus, the cost to the borrower of informal loans is much higher.\n\nHigher cost of borrowing means a larger part of the earnings of the borrowers is used to repay the loan. Hence, borrowers have less income left for themselves (as we saw for Shyamal in Sonpur). In certain cases, the high interest rate for borrowing can mean that the amount to be repaid is greater than the income of the borrower. This could lead to increasing debt (as we saw for Rama in Sonpur) and debt trap. Also, people who might wish to start an enterprise by borrowing may not do so because of the high cost of borrowing.\n\nFor these reasons, banks and cooperative societies need to lend more. This would lead to higher incomes and many people could then borrow cheaply for a variety of needs. They could grow crops,\ndo business, set up small-scale industries etc. They could set up new industries or trade in goods. Cheap and affordable credit is crucial for the country's development.\n\n## Formal and Informal Credit: Who gets what?\n\nGraph 2 shows the importance of formal and informal sources of credit for people in urban areas. The people are divided into four groups, from poor to rich, as shown in the figure. You can see that 54 per cent of the loans taken by poor households in the urban areas are from informal sources. Compare this with the rich urban households. What do you find? Only 17 per cent of their loans are from informal sources, while 83 per cent are from formal sources. A similar pattern is also found in rural areas. The rich households are availing cheap credit from formal lenders whereas the poor households have to pay a large amount for borrowing.\n\nWhat does all this suggest? First, the formal sector still meets only about half of the total credit needs of the rural people. The remaining credit needs are met from informal sources.\n\nGraph 2 : Of all the loans taken by urban households, what percentage was formal and what percentage was informal?\n\n\n**[IMAGE: Pie charts showing the percentage of loans from formal and informal sectors for different household categories.]**\n\n",

Thus, it is necessary that banks and cooperatives increase their lending particularly in the rural areas, so that the dependence on informal sources of credit reduces.\n\nSecondly, while formal sector loans need to expand, it is also necessary that everyone receives these loans.

Why is it so? Banks are not present everywhere in rural India. Even when they are present, getting a loan from a bank is much more difficult than taking a loan from informal sources. As we saw for Megha, bank loans require proper\ndocuments and collateral. Absence of collateral is one of the major reasons which prevents the poor from getting bank loans.

      "content": "their earlier loans. However, the moneylenders charge very high rates of interest, keep no records of the transactions and harass the poor borrowers.\n\nIn recent years, people have tried out some newer ways of providing loans to the poor. The idea is to organise rural poor, in particular women, into small Self Help Groups (SHGs) and pool (collect) their savings. A typical SHG has 15-20 members, usually belonging to one neighbourhood, who meet and save regularly. Saving per member varies from Rs 25 to Rs 100 or more, depending on the ability of the people to save. Members can take small loans from the group itself to meet their needs. The group charges interest on these loans but this is still less than what the moneylender charges. After a year or two, if the group is regular in savings, it becomes eligible for availing loan from the bank. Loan is sanctioned in the name of the group and is meant to create selfemployment opportunities for the members. For instance, small loans are provided to the members for releasing mortgaged land, for meeting working capital needs (e.g. buying seeds, fertilisers, raw materials like bamboo and cloth), for housing materials, for acquiring assets like sewing machine, handlooms, cattle, etc.\n\nMost of the important decisions regarding the savings and loan activities are taken by the group members. The group decides as regards the loans\nto be granted - the purpose, amount, interest to be charged, repayment schedule etc. Also, it is the group which is responsible for the repayment of the loan. Any case of nonrepayment of loan by any one member is followed up seriously by other members in the group. Because of this feature, banks are willing to lend to the poor women when organised in SHGs, even though they have no collateral as such.\n\nThus, the SHGs help borrowers overcome the problem of lack of collateral. They can get timely loans for a variety of purposes and at a reasonable interest rate. Moreover, SHGs are the building blocks of organisation of the rural poor. Not only does it help women to become financially self-reliant, the regular meetings of the group provide a platform to discuss and act on a variety of social issues such as health, nutrition, domestic violence, etc.\n\nA women's self-help group meeting in Gujarat",

      "content": "# Grameen Bank of Bangladesh \n\nGrameen Bank of Bangladesh is one of the biggest success stories in reaching the poor to meet their credit needs at reasonable rates. Started in the 1970s as a small project, Grameen Bank in 2018 had over 9 million members in about 81,600 villages spread across Bangladesh. Almost all of the borrowers are women and belong to poorest sections of the society. These borrowers have proved that not only are poor women reliable borrowers, but that they can start and run a variety of small income-generating activities successfully.\n\"If credit can be made available to the poor people on terms and conditions that are appropriate and reasonable these millions of small people with their millions of small pursuits can add up to create the biggest development wonder.\"\n\nProfessor Muhammad Yunus, the founder of Grameen Bank, and recipient of 2006 Nobel Prize for Peace\n\n## SUMMING UP\n\nIn this chapter we have looked at the modern forms of money and how they are linked with the banking system. On one side are the depositors who keep their money in the banks and on the other side are the borrowers who take loans from these banks. Economic activities require loans or credit. Credit, as we saw can have a positive impact, or in certain situations make the borrower worse off.\n\nCredit is available from a variety of sources. These can be either formal sources or informal sources. Terms of\ncredit vary substantially between formal and informal lenders. At present, it is the richer households who receive credit from formal sources whereas the poor have to depend on the informal sources. It is essential that the total formal sector credit increases so that the dependence on the more expensive informal credit becomes less. Also, the poor should get a much greater share of formal loans from banks, cooperative societies etc. Both these steps are important for development.\n\n## EXERCISES\n\n1. In situations with high risks, credit might create further problems for the borrower. Explain.\n2. How does money solve the problem of double coincidence of wants? Explain with an example of your own.\n3. How do banks mediate between those who have surplus money and those who need money?\n4. Look at a 10 rupee note. What is written on top? Can you explain this statement?\n5. Why do we need to expand formal sources of credit in India?\n6. What is the basic idea behind the SHGs for the poor? Explain in your own words.\n7. What are the reasons why the banks might not be willing to lend to certain borrowers?",

      "content": "# NOTES FOR THE TEACHER \n\n## CHAPTER 4 : GLOBALISATION AND THE INDIAN ECONOMY\n\nMost regions of the world are getting increasingly interconnected. While this interconnectedness across countries has many dimensions cultural, political, social and economic - this chapter looks at globalisation in a more limited sense. It defines globalisation as the integration between countries through foreign trade and foreign investments by multinational corporations (MNCs). As you will notice, the more complex issues of portfolio investment have been left out.\n\nIf we look at the past thirty years or so, we find that MNCs have been a major force in the globalisation process connecting distant regions of the world. Why are the MNCs spreading their production to other countries and what are the ways in which they are doing so? The first part of the chapter discusses this. Rather than relying on quantitative estimates, the rapid rise and influence of the MNCs has been shown through a variety of examples, mainly drawn from the Indian context. Note that the examples are an aid to explain a more general point. While teaching, the emphasis should be on the ideas and examples are to be used as illustrations. You can also creatively use comprehension passages like the one given after Section II to test and reinforce new concepts.\n\nIntegration of production and integration of markets is a key idea behind understanding the process of globalisation and its impact. This has been dealt with at length in this chapter, highlighting the role of MNCs in the process. You have to ensure that the students grasp this idea with sufficient clarity, before moving on to the next topic.\n\nGlobalisation has been facilitated by several factors. Three of these have been highlighted: rapid improvements in technology, liberalisation\nof trade and investment policies and, pressures from international organisations such as the WTO. Improvement in technology is a fascinating area for students and you may, with a few directions, encourage them to do their own explorations. While discussing liberalisation, you have to keep in mind that the students are unaware of what India was like in the pre-liberalisation era. A role-play could be conceived to compare and contrast the pre and post-liberalisation era. Similarly, international negotiations under WTO and the uneven balances in power are interesting subjects that can be covered in a discussion mode rather than as lectures.\n\nThe final section covers the impact of globalisation. To what extent has globalisation contributed to the development process? This section draws on the topics covered in Chapters 1 and 2 (for example, what is a fair development goal), which you can refer to. Also, examples and activities drawn from the local environment are a must while discussing this section. This might include contexts that have not been covered in the chapter, such as the impact of imports on local farmers, etc. Collective brainstorming sessions can be conducted to analyse such situations.\n\n## Sources for Information\n\nThe call for a fairer globalisation has been given, among others, by the International Labour Organisation - www.ilo.org. Another interesting resource is the WTO website http://www.wto.org. It gives access to the variety of agreements that are being negotiated at the WTO. For company related information, most MNCs have their own websites. If you want to critically look at the MNCs, one recommended website is www.corporatewatch.org.uk.",

      "content": "# PRODUCTION ACROSS COUNTRIES \n\nUntil the middle of the twentieth century, production was largely organised within countries. What crossed the boundaries of these countries were raw material, food stuff and finished products. Colonies such as India exported raw materials and food stuff and imported finished goods. Trade was the main channel connecting distant countries. This was before large companies called\nmultinational corporations (MNCs) emerged on the scene. A MNC is a company that owns or controls production in more than one nation. MNCs set up offices and factories for production in regions where they can get cheap labour and other resources. This is done so that the cost of production is low and the MNCs can earn greater profits. Consider the following example.\n\n## Spreading of Production by an MNC\n\nA large MNC, producing industrial equipment, designs its products in research centres in the United States, and then has the components manufactured in China. These are then shipped to Mexico and Eastern Europe where the products are assembled and the finished products are sold all over the world. Meanwhile, the company's customer care is carried out through call centres located in India.\n\nThis is a call centre in Bengaluru, equipped with telecom facilities and access to the Internet to provide information and support to customers abroad.\n\n\n**[IMAGE: A photo of a call center with employees working at their desks with computers and headsets.]**\n\n",

      "content": "In this example the MNC is not only selling its finished products globally, but more important, the goods and services are produced globally. As a result, production is organised in increasingly complex ways. The production process is divided into small parts and spread out across the globe. In the above example, China provides the advantage of being a cheap manufacturing location. Mexico and Eastern Europe are useful\nfor their closeness to the markets in the US and Europe. India has highly skilled engineers who can understand the technical aspects of production. It also has educated English speaking youth who can provide customer care services. And all this probably can mean 50-60 per cent cost-savings for the MNC! The advantage of spreading out production across the borders to the multinationals can be truly immense.\n\n# LET'S WORK THIS OUT \n\nComplete the following statement to show how the production process in the garment industry is spread across countries.\n\nThe brand tag says 'Made in Thailand' but they are not Thai products. We dissect the manufacturing process and look for the best solution at each step. We are doing it globally. In making garments, the company may, for example, get cotton fibre from Korea, $\\qquad$\n\n## INTERLINKING PRODUCTION ACROSS COUNTRIES\n\nIn general, MNCs set up production where it is close to the markets; where there is skilled and unskilled labour available at low costs; and where the availability of other factors of production is assured. In addition, MNCs might look for government policies that look after their interests. You will read more about the policies later in the chapter.\n\nHaving assured themselves of these conditions, MNCs set up factories and offices for production. The money that is spent to buy assets such as land, building, machines and other equipment is called investment. Investment made by MNCs is called foreign investment. Any investment is made with the hope that these assets will earn profits.\n\nAt times, MNCs set up production jointly with some of the local companies of these countries. The benefit to the local company of such joint production is two-fold. First, MNCs can provide money for additional investments, like buying new machines for faster production. Second, MNCs might bring with them the latest technology for production.\n\n\n**[IMAGE: A cartoon depicting a businessman deciding to shift a factory to another country due to rising costs and demands for better conditions and higher wages.]**\n\n\n\nGlobalisation and the Indian Economy",

      "content": "But the most common route for MNC investments is to buy up local companies and then to expand production. MNCs with huge wealth can quite easily do so. To take an example, Cargill Foods, a very large American MNC, has bought over smaller Indian companies such as Parakh Foods. Parakh Foods had built a large marketing network in various parts of India, where its brand was well-reputed. Also, Parakh Foods had four oil refineries, whose control has now shifted to Cargill. Cargill is now the largest producer of edible oil in India, with a capacity to make 5 million pouches daily!\n\nIn fact, many of the top MNCs have wealth exceeding the entire budgets of the developing country governments. With such enormous wealth, imagine the power and influence of these MNCs!\n\nThere's another way in which MNCs control production. Large MNCs in developed countries place orders for production with small producers. Garments, footwear, sports items are examples of industries where production is carried out by a large number of small producers around the world.\n\nWomen at home in Ludhiana making footballs for large MNCs\n\n\n**[IMAGE: A photo depicting three women engaged in a conversation or activity in a rural setting.]**\n\n\n\nJeans produced in developing countries being sold in USA for Rs 6500 (\\$145)\n\nThe products are supplied to the MNCs, which then sell these under their own brand names to the customers. These large MNCs have tremendous power to determine price, quality, delivery, and labour conditions for these distant producers.\n\nThus, we see that there are a variety of ways in which the MNCs are spreading their production and interacting with local producers in various countries across the globe. By setting up partnerships with local companies, by using the local companies for supplies, by closely competing with the local companies or buying them up, MNCs are exerting a strong influence on production at these distant locations. As a result, production in these widely dispersed locations is getting interlinked.",

      "content": "# LET'S WORK THESE OUT \n\nFord Motors, an American company, is one of the world's largest automobile manufacturers with production spread over 26 countries of the world. Ford Motors came to India in 1995 and spent Rs. 1700 crore to set up a large plant near Chennai. This was done in collaboration with Mahindra and Mahindra, a major Indian manufacturer of jeeps and trucks. By the year 2017, Ford Motors was selling 88,000 cars in the Indian markets,\nwhile another 1,81,000 cars were exported from India to South Africa, Mexico, Brazil and United States of America. In recent years, Ford Company stopped producing cars for selling in India but export cars and car engines on a small scale to other countries.\n\nRead the passage on the left and answer the questions.\n\n1. Would you say Ford Motors is a MNC? Why?\n2. What is foreign investment? How much did Ford Motors invest in India?\n3. By setting up their production plants in India, MNCs such as Ford Motors tap the advantage not only of the large markets that countries such as India provide, but also the lower costs of production. Explain the statement.\n4. Why do you think the company wants to develop India as a base for manufacturing car components for its global operations? Discuss the following factors:\n(a) cost of labour and other resources in India\n(b) the presence of several local manufacturers who supply autoparts to Ford Motors\n(c) closeness to a large number of buyers in India and China\n5. In what ways will the production of cars by Ford Motors in India lead to interlinking of production?\n6. In what ways is a MNC different from other companies?\n7. Nearly all major multinationals are American, Japanese or European, such as Nike, Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Honda, Nokia. Can you guess why?\n\n\n**[IMAGE: Cars made by Indian workers being transported to be sold abroad by MNCs.]**\n\n\n\n## FOREIGN TRADE AND\n\n## INTEGRATION OF MARKETS\n\nFor a long time foreign trade has been the main channel connecting countries. In history you would have read about the trade routes connecting India and South Asia to markets both in the East and West and the extensive trade that took place along these routes. Also, you would remember that it was trading interests which attracted various trading companies such as the East India Company to India. What then is the basic function of foreign trade?\n\nTo put it simply, foreign trade creates an opportunity for the producers to reach beyond the domestic markets, i.e., markets of their own countries. Producers can sell their produce not only in markets located within the country but can also compete in markets located in other countries of the world. Similarly, for the buyers, import of goods produced in another country is one way of expanding the choice of goods beyond what is domestically produced.",

They start exporting plastic toys to India. Buyers in India now have the option of choosing between Indian and the Chinese toys. Because of the cheaper prices and new designs, Chinese toys become more popular in the Indian markets. Within a year, 70 to 80 per cent of the toy shops have replaced Indian toys with Chinese toys. Toys are now cheaper in the Indian markets than earlier.\n\nWhat is happening here? As a result of trade, Chinese toys come into the Indian markets. In the competition between Indian and Chinese toys, Chinese toys prove better. Indian buyers have a greater choice of toys and at lower prices. For the Chinese toy makers, this provides an opportunity to expand business. The opposite is true for Indian toy makers. They face losses, as their toys are selling much less.\n\n\n**[IMAGE: A colorful toy resembling a dog with interactive buttons.]**\n\n",

Likewise, activities of most MNCs involve substantial trade in goods and also services.\n\n\n**[IMAGE: A cartoon depicting the impact of globalisation, showing a man playing with a globe and a woman warning him about the consequences.]**\n\n\n\nGlobalisation and the Indian Economy",

In the past few decades, however, there has not been much increase in the movement of people between countries due to various restrictions.\n\n\n**[IMAGE: A photo depicting traditional transportation methods with a humorous note on improvements in transportation.]**\n\n\n\n# FACTORS THAT HAVE ENABLED GLOBALISATION \n\n## Technology\n\nRapid improvement in technology has been one major factor that has stimulated the globalisation process. For instance, the past fifty years have seen several improvements in transportation technology.

      "content": "## Liberalisation of foreign trade and foreign investment policy\n\nLet us return to the example of imports of Chinese toys in India. Suppose the Indian government puts a tax on import of toys. What would happen? Those who wish to import these toys would have to pay tax on this. Because of the tax, buyers will have to pay a higher price on imported toys. Chinese toys will no longer be as cheap in the Indian markets and imports from China will automatically reduce. Indian toy-makers will prosper.\n\nTax on imports is an example of trade barrier. It is called a barrier because some restriction has been set up. Governments can use trade barriers to increase or decrease (regulate) foreign trade and to decide what kinds of goods and how much of each, should come into the country.\n\nThe Indian government, after Independence, had put barriers to foreign trade and foreign investment. This was considered necessary to protect the producers within the country from foreign competition. Industries were just coming up in the 1950s and 1960s, and competition from imports at that stage would not have allowed these industries to come up. Thus, India allowed imports of only essential items such as\nmachinery, fertilisers, petroleum etc. Note that all developed countries, during the early stages of development, have given protection to domestic producers through a variety of means.\n\nStarting around 1991, some farreaching changes in policy were made in India. The government decided that the time had come for Indian producers to compete with producers around the globe. It felt that competition would improve the performance of producers within the country since they would have to improve their quality. This decision was supported by powerful international organisations.\n\nThus, barriers on foreign trade and foreign investment were removed to a large extent. This meant that goods could be imported and exported easily and also foreign companies could set up factories and offices here.\n\nRemoving barriers or restrictions set by the government is what is known as liberalisation. With liberalisation of trade, businesses are allowed to make decisions freely about what they wish to import or export. The government imposes much less restrictions than before and is therefore said to be more liberal.\n\n# LET'S WORK THESE OUT \n\n1. What do you understand by liberalisation of foreign trade?\n2. Tax on imports is one type of trade barrier. The government could also place a limit on the number of goods that can be imported. This is known as quotas. Can you explain, using the example of Chinese toys, how quotas can be used as trade barriers? Do you think this should be used? Discuss.",

      "content": "# WORLD TRADE ORGANISATION \n\nWe have seen that the liberalisation of foreign trade and investment in India was supported by some very powerful international organisations. These organisations say that all barriers to foreign trade and investment are harmful. There should be no barriers. Trade between countries should be 'free'. All countries in the world should liberalise their policies.\n\nWorld Trade Organisation (WTO) is one such organisation whose aim is to liberalise international trade. Started at the initiative of the\ndeveloped countries, WTO establishes rules regarding international trade, and sees that these rules are obeyed. About 160 countries of the world are currently members of the WTO.\n\nThough WTO is supposed to allow free trade for all, in practice, it is seen that the developed countries have unfairly retained trade barriers. On the other hand, WTO rules have forced the developing countries to remove trade barriers. An example of this is the current debate on trade in agricultural products.\n\n## Debate on Trade Practices\n\nYou have seen in Chapter 2, that the agriculture sector provides the bulk of employment and a significant portion of the GDP in India. Compare this to a developed country such as the US with the share of agriculture in GDP at $1 \\%$ and its share in total employment a tiny 0.5\\%! And yet this very small percentage of people who are engaged in agriculture in the US receive massive sums of money from the US government for production and for exports to other countries. Due to this massive money that they receive, US farmers can sell the farm products at abnormally low prices. The surplus farm products are sold in other country markets at low prices, adversely affecting farmers in these countries.\n\nDeveloping countries are, therefore, asking the developed country governments, \"We have reduced trade barriers as per WTO rules. But you have ignored the rules of WTO and have continued to pay your farmers vast sums of money. You have asked our governments to stop supporting our farmers, but you are doing so yourselves. Is this free and fair trade?\"\n\nA typical cotton farm in USA consists of thousands of acres owned by a huge corporation that will sell cotton abroad at lowered prices.\n\n\n**[IMAGE: A field of cotton plants ready for harvest.]**\n\n",

At times, governments also give support to promote production of certain types of goods, such as those which are environmentally friendly. Discuss whether these are fair or not.\n\n## IMPACT OF GLOBALISATION IN INDIA\n\nIn the last twenty years, globalisation of the Indian economy has come a long way. What has been its effect on the lives of people? Let us look at some of the evidence.\n\nGlobalisation and greater competition among producers - both local and foreign producers - has been of advantage to consumers, particularly the well-off sections in the urban areas. There is greater choice before these consumers who now enjoy improved quality and lower prices for several products. As a result, these people today, enjoy much higher standards of living than was possible earlier.\n\nAmong producers and workers, the impact of globalisation has not been uniform.\n\nFirstly, MNCs have increased their investments in India over the past 20 years, which means investing in India has been beneficial for them. MNCs have been interested in industries such as cell phones, automobiles, electronics, soft drinks, fast food or services such as banking in urban areas. These products have a large number of well-off buyers. In these industries and services, new jobs have been created. Also, local companies supplying raw materials, etc. to these industries have prospered.\n\n\n**[IMAGE: A person on a bicycle in an underground passage with advertisements.]**\n\n",

      "content": "# Steps to Attract Foreign Investment \n\nIn recent years, the central and state governments in India are taking special steps to attract foreign companies to invest in India. Industrial zones, called Special Economic Zones (SEZs), are being set up. SEZs are to have world class facilities: electricity, water, roads, transport, storage, recreational and educational facilities. Companies who set up production units in the SEZs do not have to pay taxes for an initial period of five years.\n\nGovernment has also allowed flexibility in the labour laws to attract foreign investment. You have seen in Chapter 2 that the companies in the organised sector have to obey certain rules that aim to protect the workers'\nrights. In the recent years, the government has allowed companies to ignore many of these. Instead of hiring workers on a regular basis, companies hire workers 'flexibly' for short periods when there is intense pressure of work. This is done to reduce the cost of labour for the company. However, still not satisfied, foreign companies are demanding more flexibility in labour laws.\n\n\n**[IMAGE: A cartoon image of a person in a lab coat pointing and saying 'Now, we are ready to invest!']**\n\n\n\nSecondly, several of the top Indian companies have been able to benefit from the increased competition. They have invested in newer technology and production methods and raised their production standards. Some have gained from successful collaborations with foreign companies.\n\nMoreover, globalisation has enabled some large Indian companies to emerge as multinationals themselves! Tata Motors (automobiles), Infosys (IT), Ranbaxy (medicines), Asian Paints (paints), Sundaram Fasteners (nuts and bolts)\nare some Indian companies which are spreading their operations worldwide.\n\nGlobalisation has also created new opportunities for companies providing services, particularly those involving IT. The Indian company producing a magazine for the London based company and call centres are some examples. Besides, a host of services such as data entry, accounting, administrative tasks, engineering are now being done cheaply in countries such as India and are exported to the developed countries.\n\n## LET'S WORK THESE OUT\n\n1. How has competition benefited people in India?\n2. Should more Indian companies emerge as MNCs? How would it benefit the people in the country?\n3. Why do governments try to attract more foreign investment?\n4. In Chapter 1, we saw what may be development for one may be destructive for others. The setting of SEZs has been opposed by some people in India. Find out who are these people and why are they opposing it.",

Ravi took a loan from the bank to start his own company producing capacitors in 1992 in Hosur, an industrial town in Tamil Nadu. Capacitors are used in many electronic home appliances including tube lights, television etc. Within three years, he was able to expand production and had 20 workers working under him.\nHis struggle to run his company started when the government removed restrictions on imports of capacitors as per its agreement at WTO in 2001. His main clients, the television companies,\nused to buy different components including capacitors in bulk for the manufacture of television sets. However, competition from the MNC brands forced the Indian television companies to move into assembling activities for MNCs. Even when some of them bought capacitors, they would prefer to import as the price of the imported item was half the price charged by people like Ravi.\nRavi now produces less than half the capacitors that he produced in the year 2000 and has only seven workers working for him. Many of Ravi's friends in the same business in Hyderabad and Chennai have closed their units.\n\nBatteries, capacitors, plastics, toys, tyres, dairy products, and vegetable oil are some examples of industries where the small manufacturers have been hit hard due to competition. Several of the units have shut down rendering many workers jobless. The small and medium industries in India employ the largest number of workers ( 11 crores) in the country, next only to agriculture.\n\n## LET'S WORK THESE OUT\n\n1. What are the ways in which Ravi's small production unit was affected by rising competition?\n2. Should producers such as Ravi stop production because their cost of production is higher compared to producers in other countries? What do you think?\n3. Recent studies point out that small producers in India need three things to compete better in the market (a) better roads, power, water, raw materials, marketing and information network (b) improvements and modernisation of technology (c) timely availability of credit at reasonable interest rates.\n\n- Can you explain how these three things would help Indian producers?\n- Do you think MNCs will be interested in investing in these? Why?\n- Do you think the government has a role in making these facilities available? Why?\n- Can you think of any other step that the government could take? Discuss.",

Faced with growing competition, most employers these days prefer to employ workers 'flexibly'. This means that workers' jobs are no longer secure.\n\nLet us see how the workers in the garment export industry in India are having to bear this pressure of competition.\n\n\n**[IMAGE: Workers in the garment export industry in India facing competition pressure.]**\n\n\n\nFactory workers folding garments for export. Though globalisation has created opportunities for paid work for women, the condition of employment shows that women are denied their fair share of benefits.\n\nLarge MNCs in the garment industry in Europe and America order their products from Indian exporters. These large MNCs with worldwide network look for the cheapest goods in order to maximise their profits. To get these large orders, Indian garment exporters try hard to cut their own costs. As cost of raw materials cannot be reduced, exporters try to cut labour costs. Where earlier a factory used to employ workers on a permanent basis, now they employ workers only on a temporary basis so that they do not have to pay workers for the whole year. Workers also have to put in very long working hours and work night shifts on a regular basis during the peak season. Wages are low and workers are forced to work overtime to make both ends meet.\n\nWhile this competition among the garment exporters has allowed the MNCs to make large profits, workers are denied their fair share of benefits brought about by globalisation.\n\n## A Garment Worker\n\n35 year old Sushila has spent many years as a worker in garment export industry of Delhi. She was employed as a 'permanent worker' entitled to health insurance, provident fund, overtime at a double rate, when Sushila's factory closed in the late 1990s. After searching for a job for six months, she finally got a job 30 km . away from where she lives. Even after working in this factory for several years, she is a temporary worker and earns less than half of what she was earning earlier. Sushila leaves her house every morning, seven days a week at 7:30 a.m. and returns at 10 p.m. A day off from work means no wage. She has none of the benefits she used to get earlier. Factories closer to her home have widely fluctuating orders and therefore pay even less.",

      "content": "The conditions of work and the hardships of the workers described above have become common to many industrial units and services in India. Most workers, today, are employed in the unorganised sector. Moreover, increasingly conditions of work in the organised sector have come to resemble the unorganised sector. Workers in the organised sector such as Sushila no longer get the protection and benefits that they enjoyed earlier.\n\n# LET'S WORK THESE OUT \n\n1. In what ways has competition affected workers, Indian exporters and foreign MNCs in the garment industry?\n2. What can be done by each of the following so that the workers can get a fair share of benefits brought by globalisation?\n(a) government\n(b) employers at the exporting factories\n(c) MNCs\n(d) workers.\n3. One of the present debates in India is whether companies should have flexible policies for employment. Based on what you have read in the chapter, summarise the point of view of the employers and workers.\n\n## THE STRUGGLE FOR A FAIR GLOBALISATION\n\nThe above evidence indicates that not everyone has benefited from globalisation. People with education, skill and wealth have made the best use of the new opportunities. On the other hand, there are many people who have not shared the benefits.\n\nSince globalisation is now a reality, the question is how to make globalisation more 'fair'? Fair globalisation would create opportunities for all, and also ensure that the benefits of globalisation are shared better.\n\nThe government can play a major role in making this possible. Its policies must protect the interests, not only of the rich and the powerful, but all the people in the country. You have read about some of the possible steps that the government can take. For instance, the government can ensure\nthat labour laws are properly implemented and the workers get their rights. It can support small producers to improve their performance till the time they become strong enough to compete. If necessary, the government can use trade and investment barriers. It can negotiate at the WTO for 'fairer rules'. It can also align with other developing countries with similar interests to fight against the domination of developed countries in the WTO.\n\nIn the past few years, massive campaigns and representation by people's organisations have influenced important decisions relating to trade and investments at the WTO. This has demonstrated that people also can play an important role in the struggle for fair globalisation.",

Globalisation is the process of rapid integration of countries. This is happening through greater foreign trade and foreign investment. MNCs are playing a major role in the globalisation process. More and more MNCs are looking for locations around the world that are cheap for their production. As a result, production is being organised in complex ways.\n\nTechnology, particularly IT, has played a big role in organising production across countries. In addition, liberalisation of trade and\ninvestment has facilitated globalisation by removing barriers to trade and investment. At the international level, WTO has put pressure on developing countries to liberalise trade and investment.\n\nWhile globalisation has benefited well-off consumers and also producers with skill, education and wealth, many small producers and workers have suffered as a result of the rising competition. Fair globalisation would create opportunities for all, and also ensure that the benefits of globalisation are shared better.",

      "content": "# NOTES FOR THE TEACHER \n\n## CHAPTER 5 : CONSUMER RIGHTS\n\nThis chapter proposes to discuss the issue of consumer rights within the context of the ways markets operate in our country. There are many aspects of unequal situations in a market and poor enforcement of rules and regulations. Hence, there is a need to sensitise learners and encourage them to participate in the consumer movement. This chapter provides case histories - how some consumers were exploited in real life situation and how legal institutions helped consumers in getting compensated and in upholding their rights. The case histories would enable the students to link these narratives to their life experiences. We have to enable students to understand that the awareness of being a well-informed consumer arose out of consumer movement and active participation of people through their struggles over a long period. This chapter also provides details of a few organisations helping consumers in different ways. Finally, it ends with some critical issues of the consumer movement in India.\n\n## Aspects of Teaching / Sources of Information\n\nThis chapter has questions, case studies and activities. It would be preferred that students discuss these in groups orally. Some of these could be answered in writing individually.\n\nWhile carrying out each activity you could start with a brainstorming session about the activity. Similarly, there are many opportunities for roleplay in this chapter and this could be a useful way to share their experiences and understand the issues at a deeper level. Making\nposters collectively is another way to think about these issues. This lesson contains activities, which require visits - visit to consumer protection councils, consumer organisations, District/State/National level Consumer Disputes Redressal Commissions, retail shops, marketplaces, etc. Organise the visits to maximise learners' experience. Have a discussion with them about the purpose of the visit, things they need to do beforehand and things that need to be collected and the task (report/ project / article, etc.) they would carry out after the visit. As part of this chapter, the learners may do letter-writing and speaking activities. We may have to be sensitive to the language aspect of exercises.\n\nThis chapter contains material collected from authenticated websites, books, newspapers and magazines. For example, https://consumer affairs.nic.in is a website of Central Government Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food \\& Public Distribution. Another website www.cutsinternational.org is the website of a consumer organisation working in India for 40 years. It publishes a variety of material to create consumer awareness in India. They need to be shared among learners so that they can also collect material as part of their activities. For example, case histories were taken from newspaper clippings and consumers who fought in Consumer Disputes Redressal Commissions. Let learners collect and read such material from different sources: consumer protection councils, Consumer Disputes Redressal Commissions and internet.",

      "content": "We participate in the market both as producers and consumers. As producers of goods and services we could be working in any of the sectors discussed earlier such as agriculture, industry, or services. Consumers participate in the market when they purchase goods and services that they need. These are the final goods that people as consumers use.\n\nIn the preceding chapters we discussed the need for rules and regulations or steps that would promote development. These could be for the protection of workers in the unorganised sector or to protect people from high interest rates charged by moneylenders in the informal sector. Similarly, rules and regulations are also required for protecting the environment.\n\nFor example, moneylenders in the informal sector that you read about in Chapter 3 adopt various tricks to bind the borrower; they could make the producer sell the produce to them at a low rate in return for a timely loan; they could force a small farmer like Swapna to sell her land to pay back the loan. Similarly, many people who work in the unorganised sector have to work at a low wage and accept conditions that are not fair and are also often harmful to their health. To prevent such exploitation, we have talked of rules and regulations for their protection. There are organisations that have struggled for long to ensure that these rules are followed.\n\nLikewise, rules and regulations are required for the protection of the consumers in the marketplace. Individual consumers often find themselves in a weak position. Whenever there is a complaint regarding a good or service that had been bought, the seller tries to shift all the responsibility on to the buyer. Their position usually is - \"If you didn't like what you bought, please go elsewhere\". As if the seller has no responsibility once a sale is completed! The consumer movement, as we shall discuss later, is an effort to change this situation.\n\nExploitation in the marketplace happens in various ways. For example, sometimes traders indulge in unfair trade practices such as when shopkeepers weigh less than what they should or when traders add charges that were not mentioned before, or when adulterated/defective goods are sold.\n\nMarkets do not work in a fair manner when producers are few and powerful whereas consumers purchase in small amounts and are scattered. This happens especially when large companies are producing these goods. These companies with huge wealth, power and reach can manipulate the market in various ways. At times false information is passed on through the media, and other sources to attract consumers. For example, a company for years sold powder milk for babies all over",

Discuss in the classroom.\n3. What do you think should be the role of government to protect consumers?\n\n## CONSUMER MOVEMENT\n\nThe consumer movement arose out of dissatisfaction of the consumers as many unfair practices were being indulged in by the sellers. There was no legal system available to consumers to protect them from exploitation in the marketplace. For a long time, when a consumer was not happy with a particular brand product or shop, he or she generally avoided buying that brand product, or would stop purchasing from that shop. It was presumed that it was the responsibility of consumers to be careful while buying a commodity or service. It took many years for organisations in India, and around the world, to create awareness amongst people. This has also shifted the responsibility of ensuring\nquality of goods and services on the sellers.\n\nIn India, the consumer movement as a 'social force' originated with the necessity of protecting and promoting the interests of consumers against unethical and unfair trade practices. Rampant food shortages, hoarding, black marketing, adulteration of food and edible oil gave birth to the consumer movement in an organised form in the 1960s. Till the 1970s, consumer organisations were largely engaged in writing articles and holding exhibitions. They formed consumer groups to look into the malpractices in ration shops and overcrowding in the road passenger transport. More recently, India witnessed an upsurge in the number of consumer groups.",

      "content": "# CONSUMER RIGHTS \n\n## SAFETY IS EVERYONE'S RIGHT\n\n## Reji's Suffering\n\nReji Mathew, a healthy boy studying in Class IX, was admitted in a private clinic in Kerala for removal of tonsils. An ENT surgeon performed the tonsillectomy operation under general anaesthesia. As a result of improper anaesthesia Reji showed symptoms of some brain abnormalities because of which he was crippled for life.\n\nHis father filed a complaint in the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission claiming compensation of Rs 5,00,000 for medical negligence and deficiency, in service. The State Commission, saying that the evidence was not sufficient, dismissed it. Reji's father appealed again in the National Consumer Disputes Redressal\n\n\n**[IMAGE: An illustration depicting a person in a wheelchair, highlighting issues related to disability and societal inclusion.]**\n\n\n\nCommission located in New Delhi. The National Commission after looking into the complaint, held the hospital responsible for medical negligence and directed it to pay the compensation.\n\nReji's suffering shows how a hospital, due to negligence by the doctors and staff in giving anaesthesia, crippled a student for life. While using many goods and services, we as consumers, have the right to be protected against the marketing of goods and delivery of services that are hazardous to life and property. Producers need to strictly follow the required safety rules and regulations. There are many goods and services that we purchase that require special attention to safety. For example, pressure cookers have a safety valve which, if it is defective, can cause a serious accident. The manufacturers of the safety valve have to ensure high quality. You also need public or government action to see that this quality is maintained. However, we do find bad quality products in the market because the supervision of these rules is weak and the consumer movement is also not strong enough.\n\n## LET'S WORK THESE OUT\n\n1. For the following (you can add to the list) products/services discuss what safety rules should be observed by the producer?\n(a) LPG cylinder (b) cinema theatre (c) circus (d) medicines (e) edible oil (f) marriage pandal (g) a high-rise building.\n2. Find out any case of accident or negligence from people around you, where you think that the responsibility lay with the producer. Discuss.",

      "content": "## Information about goods and services\n\nWhen you buy any commodity, you will find certain details given on the packing. These details are about ingredients used, price, batch number, date of manufacture, expiry date and the address of the manufacturer. When we buy medicines, on the packets, you might find 'directions for proper use' and information relating to side effects and risks associated with usage of that medicine. When you buy garments, you will find information on 'instructions for washing'.\n\nWhy is it that rules have been made so that the manufacturer displays this information? It is because consumers have the right to be informed about the particulars of goods and services that they purchase. Consumers can then complain and ask for compensation or replacement if the product proves to be defective in any manner. For example, if we buy a\nproduct and find it defective well within the expiry period, we can ask for a replacement. If the expiry period was not printed, the manufacturer would blame the shopkeeper and will not accept the responsibility. If people sell medicines that have expired severe action can be taken against them. Similarly, one can protest and complain if someone sells a good at more than the printed price on the packet. This is indicated by 'MRP' maximum retail price. In fact consumers can bargain with the seller to sell at less than the MRP.\n\nIn recent times, the right to information has been expanded to cover various services provided by the Government. In October 2005, the Government of India enacted a law, popularly known as RTI (Right to Information) Act, which ensures its citizens all the information about the functions of government departments. The effect of the RTI Act can be understood from the following case.\n\n# Waiting... \n\nAmritha, an engineering graduate after submitting all the certificates and attending the interview for a job in a government department, did not receive any news of the result. The officials also refused to comply with her queries. She therefore filed an application using the RTI Act saying that it was her right to know the result in a reasonable time so that she could plan her future. She was not only informed about the reasons for delay in the declaration of results but also got her call letter for appointment as she performed well in the interview.",

Discuss the possible reasons. Should consumer groups do something about this?\n2. Pick up a few packaged goods that you want to buy and examine the information given. In what ways are they useful? Is there some information that you think should be given on those packaged goods but is not? Discuss.\n3. People make complaints about the lack of civic amenities such as bad roads or poor water and health facilities but no one listens. Now the RTI Act gives you the power to question. Do you agree? Discuss.\n\n## When choice is denied\n\nAbirami, a student of Ansari Nagar, joined a two-year course at a local coaching institute for professional courses in New Delhi. At the time of joining the course, she paid the fees Rs 61,020 as lumpsum for the entire course of two years. However, she decided to opt out of the course at the end of one year as she found that the quality of teaching was not up to the mark. When she asked for a refund of the fee for one year, it was denied to her.\nWhen she filed the case in the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, the Commission directed the Institute to refund Rs 28,000 saying that she had the right to choose. The\n\n## A Refund\n\nInstitute again appealed in the State Consumer Com-mission. The State Commission upheld the District Commission's direction and further fined the institute Rs 25,000 for a frivolous appeal. It also directed the institute to pay Rs 7000 as compensation and litigation cost.\n\nThe State Commission also restrained all the educational and professional institutions in the state from charging fees from students for the entire duration of the course in advance and that too at one go. Any violation of this order may invite penalties and imprisonment, the commission said.\n\nWhat do we understand from this incident? Any consumer who receives a service in whatever capacity, regardless of age, gender and nature of service, has the right to choose whether to continue to receive the service.\n\nSuppose you want to buy toothpaste, and the shop owner says that she can sell the toothpaste only\nif you buy a toothbrush. If you are not interested in buying the brush, your right to choice is denied. Similarly, sometimes gas supply dealers insist that you have to buy the stove from them when you take a new connection. In this way many a times you are forced to buy things that you may not wish to and you are left with no choice.",

If any damage is done to a consumer, she has the right to get compensation depending on the degree of damage. There is a need to provide an easy and effective public system by which this can be done.\n\nThe consumer can file a complaint before the appropriate consumer forum on his/her own with or without the services of lawyers. You might be interested in knowing how an aggrieved person gets his or her compensation. Let us take the case of Prakash. He had sent a money-order to his village for his daughter's marriage. The money did not reach his daughter at the time when she needed it nor did it reach months later. Prakash filed a case in a district level Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission in New Delhi. All the steps he undertook are illustrated here. These days consumer as an individual or as a group (called class action suit) file a complaint both Physically or through internet and conduct the case through video conferencing.\n\n1.

      "content": "The consumer movement in India has led to the formation of various organisations, locally known as consumer forums or consumer protection councils. They guide consumers on how to file cases in the Consumer Disputes Redressal Commissions. On many occasions, they also represent individual consumers in these commissions. These voluntary organisations also receive financial support from the government for creating awareness among people.\n\nIf you are living in a residential colony, you might have noticed boards of Residents' Welfare Associations. If there is any unfair trade practice meted out to their members, they take up the case on their behalf.\n\nUnder COPRA, a three-tier quasi-judicial machinery at the district, state\nand national levels was set up for redressal of consumer disputes. The district-level authority called District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission deals with the cases involving claims up to Rs 1 crore, the state-level Consumer Disputes Redressal Commissions called State Commission between Rs 1 crore and Rs 10 crore and the national-level commission - National Commission - deals with cases involving claims exceeding Rs 10 crore. If a case is dismissed in district-level commission, a consumer can also appeal in the state and then in national-level commissions.\n\nThus, the Act has enabled us as consumers to have the right to represent in the Consumer Disputes Redressal Commissions.\n\n\n**[IMAGE: A diagram illustrating the importance of consumer rights to a healthy environment, addressing issues like air pollution, water pollution, and noise pollution.]**\n\n\n\n## LET'S WORK THIS OUT\n\nArrange the following in the correct order.\n(a) Arita files a case in the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission.\n(b) She engages a professional person.\n(c) She realises that the dealer has given her defective material.\n(d) She starts attending the commission proceedings.\n(e) She goes and complains to the dealer and the Branch office, to no effect.\n(f) She is asked to produce the bill and warranty before the commission.\n(g) She purchases a wall clock from a retail outlet.\n(h) Within a few months, the dealer was ordered by the commission to replace her old wall clock with a brand new one at no extra cost.\n\n## LEARNING TO BECOME WELL-INFORMED CONSUMERS\n\nWhen we as consumers become conscious of our rights, while purchasing various goods and services, we will be able to distinguish and make informed choices.
