It has moved forward displaying remarkable progress in the field of agriculture, industry, technology and overall economic development. India has also contributed significantly to the making of world history.\n\n## Location\n\nIndia is a vast country. Lying entirely in the Northern hemisphere (Figure 1.1) the main land extends between latitudes $8^{\\circ} 4^{\\prime} \\mathrm{N}$ and $37^{\\circ} 6^{\\prime} \\mathrm{N}$ and longitudes $68^{\\circ} 7^{\\prime} \\mathrm{E}$ and $97^{\\circ} 25^{\\prime} \\mathrm{E}$.\n\nThe Tropic of Cancer $\\left(23^{\\circ} 30^{\\prime} \\mathrm{N}\\right)$ divides the country into almost two equal parts. To the southeast and southwest of the mainland, lie the Andaman and Nicobar islands and the Lakshadweep islands in Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea respectively. Find out the extent of these groups of islands from your atlas.\n\n## Do You Know?\n\n- The southernmost point of the Indian Union- 'Indira Point' got submeng ed under the sea water in 2004 during the Tsunami.\n\n\n## Size\n\nThe land mass of India has an area of 3.28 million square km . India's total area accounts for about 2.4 per cent of the total geographical\n\n\n**[IMAGE: A world map showing the continents and oceans with their respective names.]**\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1 : India in the World",

      "content": "area of the world. From Figure 1.2 it is clear that India is the seventh largest country of the world. India has a land boundary of about $15,200 \\mathrm{~km}$ and the total length of the coastline of the mainland, including Andaman and Nicobar and Lakshadweep, is $7,516.6 \\mathrm{~km}$.\n\nIndia is bounded by the young fold mountains in the northwest, north and northeast. South of about $22^{\\circ}$ north latitude, it begins to taper, and extends towards the Indian Ocean, dividing it into two seas, the Arabian Sea on the west and the Bay of Bengal on its east.\n\nLook at Figure 1.3 and note that the latitudinal and longitudinal extent of the mainland is about $30^{\\circ}$. Despite this fact, the east-west extent appears to be smaller than the north-south extent.\n\nFrom Gujarat to Arunachal Pradesh, there is a time lag of two hours. Hence, time along the Standard Meridian of India ( $82^{\\circ} 30^{\\prime} \\mathrm{E}$ ) passing through Mirzapur (in Uttar Pradesh) is taken as the standard time for the whole country. The latitudinal extent influences the duration of day and night, as one moves from south to north.\n\n## Find out\n\n- Why $82^{\\circ} 30^{\\prime} \\mathrm{E}$ has been selected as the Standard Meridian of India?\n- Why is the difference between the durations of day and night hardly felt at Kanniyakumari but not so in Kashmir?\n\n\n## India and the World\n\nThe Indian landmass has a central location between the East and the West Asia. India is a southward extension of the Asian continent. The trans Indian Ocean routes, which connect the countries of Europe in the West and the countries of East Asia, provide a strategic central location to India. Note that the Deccan Peninsula protrudes into the Indian Ocean, thus helping India to establish close contact with West Asia, Africa and Europe from the western coast and with Southeast and East Asia from the eastern coast. No other country has a long coastline on the Indian Ocean as India has and indeed, it is India's eminent position in the Indian Ocean, which justifies the naming of an Ocean after it.\n\n## Do You Know?\n\nSince the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869, India's distance from Europe has been reduced by $7,000 \\mathrm{~km}$.\n\n\n**[IMAGE: A bar chart showing the area in square kilometers of the top seven largest countries in the world.]**\n\n\n\nSource : United Nations Demographic Year Book 2015\nFigure 1.2 : Seven Largest Countries of the World",

The various passes across the mountains in the north have provided passages to the ancient travellers, while the oceans restricted such interaction for a long time.\n\nThese routes have contributed in the exchange of ideas and commodities since ancient times. The ideas of the Upanishads and the Ramayana, the stories of Panchtantra, the Indian numerals and the decimal system thus could reach many parts of the world. The spices, muslin and other merchandise were taken from India to different countries. On the other hand, the influence of Greek sculpture, and the architectural styles of dome and minarets from West Asia can be seen in different parts of our country.\n\n## India's Neighbours\n\nIndia occupies an important strategic position in South Asia.

What kind of terrain do you live in? If you live in the plains, you are familiar with the vast stretches of plain land. In contrast, if you live in hilly region, the rugged terrain with mountains and valleys are common features. In fact, our country has practically all major physical features of the earth, i.e., mountains, plains, deserts, plateaus and islands.\n\nThe land of India displays great physical variation. Geologically, the Peninsular Plateau constitutes one of the ancient landmasses on the earth's surface. It was supposed to be one of the most stable land blocks. The Himalayas and the Northern Plains are the most recent landforms. From the view point of geology, Himalayan mountains form an unstable zone. The whole mountain system of Himalaya represents a very youthful topography with high peaks, deep valleys and fast flowing rivers. The northern plains are formed of alluvial deposits. The peninsular plateau is composed of igneous and metamorphic rocks with gently rising hills and wide valleys.\n\n## Major Physiographic Divisions\n\nThe physical features of India can be grouped under the following physiographic divisions (Figure 2.2):\n(1) The Himalayan Mountains\n(2) The Northern Plains\n(3) The Peninsular Plateau\n(4) The Indian Desert\n(5) The Coastal Plains\n(6) The Islands\n\n## The Himalayan Mountains\n\nThe Himalayas, geologically young and structurally fold mountains stretch over the northern borders of India. These mountain ranges run in a west-east direction from the Indus to the Brahmaputra. The Himalayas represent the loftiest and one of the most rugged mountain barriers of the world. They form an arc, which covers a distance of about $2,400 \\mathrm{Km}$. Their width varies from 400 Km in Kashmir to 150 Km in Arunachal Pradesh. The altitudinal variations are greater in the eastern half than those in the western half. The Himalaya consists of three parallel ranges in its longitudinal extent. A number of valleys lie between these ranges. The northern-most range is known as the Great or Inner Himalayas or the Himadri. It is the most continuous range consisting of the loftiest peaks with an average height of 6,000 metres. It contains all prominent Himalayan peaks.",

These ranges are composed of unconsolidated sediments brought down by rivers from the main Himalayan ranges located farther north. These valleys are covered with thick gravel and alluvium. The longitudinal valley lying between lesser Himalaya and the Shiwaliks are known as Duns. Dehra Dun, Kotli Dun and Patli Dun are some of the well-known Duns.\n\nBesides the longitudinal divisions, the Himalayas have been divided on the basis of regions from west to east. These divisions have been demarcated by river valleys. For example, the part of Himalayas lying between Indus and Satluj has been traditionally known as Punjab Himalaya but it is also known regionally as Kashmir and Himachal Himalaya from west to east respectively. The part of the Himalayas lying between Satluj and Kali rivers is known as Kumaon Himalayas. The Kali and Teesta rivers demarcate the Nepal Himalayas and the part lying between Teesta and Dihang rivers is known as Assam Himalayas. There are regional names also in these broad\ncategories. Find out some regional names of the Himalayas\n\nThe Brahmaputra marks the eastern-most boundary of the Himalayas. Beyond the Dihang gorge, the Himalayas bend sharply to the south and spread along the eastern boundary of India. They are known as the Purvachal or the Eastern hills and mountains. These hills running through the north-eastern states are mostly composed of strong sandstones, which are sedimentary rocks. Covered with dense forests, they mostly run as parallel ranges and valleys. The Purvachal comprises the Patkai hills, the Naga hills, the Manipur hills and the Mizo hills.\n\n\n**[IMAGE: A scenic view of mountainous terrain with lush greenery and red shrubs.]**\n\n\n\nFigure 2.4 : Mizo Hills",

      "content": "## The Northern Plain\n\nThe northern plain has been formed by the interplay of the three major river systems, namely - the Indus, the Ganga and the Brahmaputra along with their tributaries. This plain is formed of alluvial soil. The deposition of alluvium in a vast basin lying at the foothills of the Himalaya over millions of years, formed this fertile plain. It spreads over an area of 7 lakh sq. km. The plain being about 2400 km long and 240 to 320 km broad, is a densely populated physiographic division. With a rich soil cover combined with adequate water supply and favourable climate it is agriculturally a productive part of India.\n\n\n**[IMAGE: A group of women working in a field, possibly engaged in agricultural activities.]**\n\n\n\nFigure 2.5 : The Northern Plains\n\nThe rivers coming from northern mountains are involved in depositional work. In the lower course, due to gentle slope, the velocity of the river decreases, which results in the formation of riverine islands.\n\n## Do You Know? Majuli, in the Brahmaputra river, is the largest inhabited riverine island in the world.\n\nThe rivers in their lower course split into numerous channels due to the deposition of silt. These channels are known as distributaries.\n\nThe Northern Plain is broadly divided into three sections. The Western part of the Northern Plain is referred to as the Punjab Plains. Formed by the Indus and its tributaries, the larger part of this plain lies in Pakistan. The Indus and its tributaries - the Jhelum, the Chenab, the Ravi, the Beas and the Satluj originate in the Himalaya. This section of the plain is dominated by the doabs.\n\nDo You Know?\n'Doab' is made up of two words - 'do' meaning two and 'ab' meaning water. Similarly 'Punjab', is also made up two words - 'Punj' meaning five and 'ab' meaning water.\n\nThe Ganga plain extends between Ghaggar and Teesta rivers. It is spread over North India in Haryana, Delhi, U.P., Bihar, partly Jharkhand and West Bengal. In the East, particularly in Assam lies the Brahmaputra plain.\n\nThe northern plains are generally described as flat land with no variations in its relief. It is not true. These vast plains also have diverse relief features. According to the variations in relief features, the Northern plains can be divided into four regions. The rivers, after descending from the mountains deposit pebbles in a narrow belt of about 8 to 16 km in width lying parallel to the slopes of the Shiwaliks. It is known as bhabar. All the streams disappear in this bhabar belt. South of this belt, the streams and rivers re-emerge and create a wet, swampy and marshy region known as terai. This was a thickly forested region full of wildlife. The forests have been cleared to create agricultural land and to settle migrants from Pakistan after partition. Locate Dudhwa National Park in this region.\n\nThe largest part of the northern plain is formed of older alluvium. It lies above the floodplains of the rivers and presents a terracelike feature. This part is known as bhangar. The soil in this region contains calcareous deposits, locally known as kankar. The",

They are renewed almost every year and so are fertile, thus, ideal for intensive agriculture.\n\n## The Peninsular Plateau\n\nThe Peninsular plateau is a tableland composed of the old crystalline, igneous and metamorphic rocks. It was formed due to the breaking and drifting of the Gondwana land and thus, making it a part of the oldest landmass. The plateau has broad and shallow valleys and rounded hills. This plateau consists of two broad divisions, namely, the Central Highlands and the Deccan Plateau. The part of the Peninsular plateau lying to the north of the Narmada river, covering a major area of the Malwa plateau, is known as the Central Highlands. The Vindhyan range is bounded by the Satpura range on the south and the Aravalis on the northwest. The further westward extension gradually merges with the sandy and rocky desert of Rajasthan. The flow of the rivers draining this region, namely the Chambal, the Sind, the Betwa and the Ken is from southwest to northeast, thus indicating the slope. The Central Highlands are wider in the west but narrower in the east. The eastward extensions of this plateau are locally known as the Bundelkhand and Baghelkhand.\n\n\n**[IMAGE: A photograph of a waterfall cascading down a rocky cliff.]**\n\n\n\nFigure 2.6 : A Waterfall in Chotanagpur Plateau\n\nThe Chotanagpur plateau marks the further eastward extension, drained by the Damodar river.\n\nThe Deccan Plateau is a triangular landmass that lies to the south of the river Narmada. The Satpura range flanks its broad base in the north, while the Mahadev, the Kaimur hills and the Maikal range form its eastern extensions. Locate these hills and ranges in the Physical map of India. The Deccan Plateau is higher in the west and slopes gently eastwards. An extension of the Plateau is also visible in the northeast, locally known as the Meghalaya, Karbi-Anglong Plateau and North Cachar Hills. It is separated by a fault from the Chotanagpur Plateau. Three prominent hill ranges from the west to the east are the Garo, the Khasi and the Jaintia Hills.\n\nThe Western Ghats and the Eastern Ghats mark the western and the eastern edges of the Deccan Plateau respectively. Western Ghats lie parallel to the western coast. They are continuous and can be crossed through passes only. Locate the Thal, Bhor and Pal Ghats in the Physical map of India.\n\nThe Western Ghats are higher than the Eastern Ghats. Their average elevation is 9001600 metres as against 600 metres of the Eastern Ghats. The Eastern Ghats stretch from the Mahanadi Valley to the Nigiris in the south. The Eastern Ghats are discontinuous and irregular and dissected by rivers draining into the Bay of Bengal. The Western Ghats cause orographic rain by facing the rain bearing moist winds to rise along the western slopes of the Ghats. The Western Ghats are known by different local names. The height of the Western Ghats progressively increases from north to south. The highest peaks include the Anai Mudi (2,695 metres) and the Doda Betta (2,637 metres). Mahendragiri (1,501 metres) is the highest peak in the Eastern Ghats. Shevroy Hills and the Javadi Hills are located to the southeast of the",

Locate the famous hill stations of Udagamandalam, popularly known as Ooty and the Kodaikanal.\n\nOne of the distinct features of the Peninsular plateau is the black soil area known as Decean Trap. This is of volcanic origin, hence, the rocks are igneous. Actually, these rocks have denuded over time and are responsible for the formation of black soil. The Aravali Hills lie on the western and northwestern margins of the Peninsular plateau. These are highly eroded hills and are found as broken hills. They extend from Gujarat to Delhi in a southwest-northeast direction.\n\n## The Indian Desert\n\nThe Indian desert lies towards the western margins of the Aravali Hills. It is an undulating sandy plain covered with sand dunes. This region receives very low rainfall below 150 mm per year. It has arid climate with low vegetation cover. Streams appear during the rainy season. Soon after they disappear into the sand as they do not have enough water to reach the sea. Luni is the only large river in this region.\n\n\n**[IMAGE: A photograph depicting people walking in a desert landscape with a settlement in the background.]**\n\n\n\nFigure 2.7 : The Indian Desert\n\nBarchans (crescent-shaped dunes) cover larger areas but longitudinal dunes become\nmore prominent near the Indo-Pakistan boundary.

The western coast, sandwiched between the Western Ghats and the Arabian Sea, is a narrow plain. It consists of three sections. The northern part of the coast is called the Konkan (Mumbai-Goa), the central stretch is called the Kannad Plain, while the southern stretch is referred to as the Malabar coast.\n\n\n**[IMAGE: A photo depicting individuals working in a rice field, showcasing traditional agricultural practices.]**\n\n\n\nFigure 2.8 : The Coastal Plains\nThe plains along the Bay of Bengal are wide and level.

This group of islands is composed of small coral isalnds. Earlier they were known as Laccadive, Minicoy and Amindive. In 1973, these were named as Lakshadweep. It covers small area of 32 sq km . Kavaratti island is the administrative headquarters of Lakshadweep. This island group has great diversity of flora and fauna. The Pitti island, which is uninhabited, has a bird sanctuary.\n\n## Corals\n\nCoral polyps are short-lived microscopic organisms, which live in colonies. They flourish in shallow, mud-free and warm waters. They secrete calcium carbonate. The coral secretion and their skeletons from coral deposits in the form of reefs; they are mainly of three kinds: barrier reef, fringing reef and atolls. The Great Barrier Reef of Australia is a good example of the first kind of coral reefs. Atolls are circular or horse shoe-shaped coral reefs.\n\nNow you see the elongated chain of islands located in the Bay of Bengal extending from north to south. These are Andaman and Nicobar islands. They are bigger in size and are more numerous and scattered. The entire group of islands is divided into two broad categories - The Andaman in the north and the Nicobar in the south. It is believed that these islands are an elevated portion of submarine mountains. These island groups are of great strategic importance for the country. There is great diversity of flora and fauna in this group of islands too. These islands lie close to equator and experience equatorial climate and has thick forest cover.\n\n## Do You Know?\n\nIndia's only active volcano is found on Barren island in Andaman and Nicobar group of Islands.\n\nA detailed account of the different physiographic units highlights the unique features of each region. It would, however, be clear that each region complements the other and makes the country richer in its natural resources. The mountains are the major sources of water and forest wealth. The northern plains are the granaries of the country. They provide the base for early civilisations. The plateau is a storehouse of minerals, which has played a crucial role in the industrialisation of the country. The coastal region and island groups provide sites for fishing and port activities. Thus, the diverse physical features of the land have immense future possibilities of development.",

You will notice that small streams flowing from different directions come together to form the main river, which ultimately drains into a large water body such as a lake or a sea or an ocean. The area drained by a single river system is called a drainage basin. A closer observation on a map will indicate that any elevated area, such as a mountain or an upland, separates two drainage basins. Such an upland is known as a water divide (Figure 3.1).\n\n\n**[IMAGE: A diagram illustrating the concept of a water divide separating two streams, Stream A and Stream B.]**\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1 : Water Divide\n\n## Do You Know?\n\nThe world's largest drainage\nbasin is of the Amazon river\n\nFind out\n\n- Which river has the largest basin in India?\n\n\n## Drainage Systems in India\n\nThe drainage systems of India are mainly controlled by the broad relief features of the subcontinent. Accordingly, the Indian rivers are divided into two major groups:\n\n- the Himalayan rivers; and\n- the Peninsular rivers.\n\nApart from originating from the two major physiographic regions of India, the Himalayan and the Peninsular rivers are different from each other in many ways. Most of the Himalayan rivers are perennial. It means that they have water throughout the year. These rivers receive water from rain as well as from melted snow from the lofty mountains. The two major Himalayan rivers, the Indus and the Brahmaputra originate from the north of the mountain ranges. They have cut through the mountains making gorges. The Himalayan rivers have long courses from their source to the sea.\n\n\n**[IMAGE: A photograph of a mountainous landscape with a river flowing through a deep gorge.]**\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2 : A Gorge",

In the middle and the lower courses, these rivers form meanders, oxbow lakes, and many other depositional features in their floodplains. They also have welldeveloped deltas (Figure 3.3).\n\n\n**[IMAGE: A diagram illustrating the different stages of a river from its source to its delta, including features like meanders and ox-bow lakes.]**\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3 : Some Features Made by Rivers\n\nA large number of the Peninsular rivers are seasonal, as their flow is dependent on rainfall. During the dry season, even the large rivers have reduced flow of water in their channels. The Peninsular rivers have shorter and shallower courses as compared to their Himalayan counterparts. However, some of them originate in the central highlands and flow towards the west. Can you identify two such large rivers? Most of the rivers of peninsular India originate in the Western Ghats and flow towards the Bay of Bengal.\n\n## The Himalayan Rivers\n\nThe major Himalayan rivers are the Indus, the Ganga and the Brahmaputra. These rivers are long, and are joined by many large and important tributaries. A river alongwith its tributaries may be called a river system.\n\n## The Indus River System\n\nThe river Indus rises in Tibet, near Lake Mansarowar. Flowing west, it enters India in the Ladakh. It forms a picturesque gorge in this part. Several tributaries, the Zaskar, the Nubra, the Shyok and the Hunza, join it in the Kashmir region. The Indus flows through Baltistan and Gilgit and emerges from the mountains at Attock. The Satluj, the Beas, the Ravi, the Chenab and the Jhelum join together to enter the Indus near Mithankot in Pakistan. Beyond this, the Indus flows southwards eventually reaching the Arabian Sea, east of Karachi. The Indus plain has a very gentle slope. With a total length of 2900 km , the Indus is one of the longest rivers of the world. A little over a third of the Indus basin is located in India Ladakh, Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Punjab and the rest is in Pakistan.\n\n## Do You Know?\n\n- According to the regulations of the Indus Water Treaty (1960), India can use only 20 per cent of the total water carried by the Indus river system. This water is used for irrigation in Punjab, Haryana and the southern and the western parts of Rajasthan.\n\n\n## The Ganga River System\n\nThe headwaters of the Ganga, called the 'Bhagirathi' is fed by the Gangotri Glacier and joined by the Alaknanda at Devaprayag in Uttarakhand. At Haridwar, the Ganga emerges from the mountains on to the plains.",

The river Yamuna rises from the Yamunotri Glacier in the Himalayas. It flows parallel to the Ganga and as a right bank tributary meets the Ganga at Allahabad. The Ghaghara, the Gandak and the Kosi rise in the Nepal Himalaya. They are the rivers, which flood parts of the northern plains every year, causing widespread damage to life and property, whereas, they enrich the soil for agricultural use.\n\nThe main tributaries, which come from the peninsular uplands, are the Chambal, the Betwa and the Son. These rise from semi-arid areas, have shorter courses and do not carry much water in them. Find out where and how they ultimately join the Ganga.\n\n## Do You Know?\n\n- The Namami Gange Programme is an Integrated Conservation Mission approved as a 'flagship programme' by the Union Government in June 2014 to accomplish the twin objectives of effective abatement of pollution, conservation and rejuvenation of the national river, Ganga. You may explore about this project at http://nmcg.nic.in/ NamamiGanga.sspx\\#\n\nEnlarged with the waters from its right and left bank tributaries, the Ganga flows eastwards till Farakka in West Bengal. This is\nthe northernmost point of the Ganga delta. The river bifurcates here; the Bhagirathi-Hooghly (a distributary) flows southwards through the deltaic plains to the Bay of Bengal. The mainstream, flows southwards into Bangladesh and is joined by the Brahmaputra. Further downstream, it is known as the Meghna. This mighty river, with waters from the Ganga and the Brahmaputra, flows into the Bay of Bengal. The delta formed by these rivers is known as the Sundarban Delta.\n\n## Do You Know?\n\n- The Sundarban Delta derived its name from the Sundari tree, which grows well in marshland.\n- It is the world's largest and fastest growing delta. It is also the home of Royal Bengal tiger.\n\nThe length of the Ganga is over 2500 km . Look at Figure 3.4; can you identify the type of drainage pattern formed by the Ganga river system? Ambala is located on the water divide between the Indus and the Ganga river systems. The plains from Ambala to the Sunderban stretch over nearly 1800 km , but the fall in its slope is hardly 300 metres. In other words, there is a fall of just one metre for every 6 km . Therefore, the river develops large meanders.\n\n## The Brahmaputra River System\n\nThe Brahmaputra rises in Tibet east of Mansarowar lake very close to the sources of the Indus and the Satluj. It is slightly longer than the Indus, and most of its course lies outside India. It flows eastwards parallel to the Himalayas. On reaching the Namcha Barwa ( 7757 m ), it takes a 'U' turn and enters India in Arunachal Pradesh through a gorge. Here, it is called the Dihang and it is joined by the Dibang, the Lohit, and many other tributaries to form the Brahmaputra in Assam.\n\n## Do You Know?\n\n- Brahmaputra is known as the Tsang Po in Tibet and Jamuna in Bangladesh.",

      "content": "In Tibet, the river carries a smaller volume of water and less silt as it is a cold and a dry area. In India, it passes through a region of high rainfall. Here the river carries a large volume of water and considerable amount of silt. The Brahmaputra has a braided channel in its entire length in Assam and forms many riverine islands. Do you remember the name of the world's largest riverine island formed by the Brahmaputra?\n\nEvery year during the rainy season, the river overflows its banks, causing widespread devastation due to floods in Assam and Bangladesh. Unlike other north Indian rivers, the Brahmaputra is marked by huge deposits of silt on its bed causing the riverbed to rise. The river also shifts its channel frequently.\n\n## The Peninsular Rivers\n\nThe main water divide in Peninsular India is formed by the Western Ghats, which runs from north to south close to the western coast. Most of the major rivers of the Peninsula, such as the Mahanadi, the Godavari, the Krishna and the Kaveri flow eastwards and drain into the Bay of Bengal. These rivers make deltas at their mouths. There are numerous small streams flowing west of the Western Ghats. The Narmada and the Tapi are the only long rivers, which flow west and make esturies. The drainage basins of the peninsular rivers are comparatively smaller in size.\n\n## The Narmada Basin\n\nThe Narmada rises in the Amarkantak hills in Madhya Pradesh. It flows towards the west in a rift valley formed due to faulting. On its way to the sea, the Narmada creates many picturesque locations. The 'Marble rocks', near Jabalpur, where the Narmada flows through a deep gorge, and the 'Dhuadhar falls, where the river plunges over steep rocks, are some of the notable ones.\n\nDo You Know?\n\n- The Narmada river conservation mission has been undertaken by the government of Madhya Pradesh by a scheme named Namami Devi Narmade. You may visit their website. http://www.namamidevinarmade.mp.gov.in to learn more about it.\n\nAll tributaries of the Narmada are very short and most of these join the main stream at right angles. The Narmada basin covers parts of Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat.\n\n## The Tapi Basin\n\nThe Tapi rises in the Satpura ranges, in the Betul district of Madhya Pradesh. It also flows in a rift valley parallel to the Narmada but it is much shorter in length. Its basin covers parts of Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Maharashtra.\n\nThe coastal plains between Western Ghats and the Arabian Sea are very narrow. Hence, the coastal rivers are short. The main west flowing rivers are Sabarmati, Mahi, Bharathpuzha and Periyar. Find out the states in which these rivers drain the water.\n\n## The Godavari Basin\n\nThe Godavari is the largest Peninsular river. It rises from the slopes of the Western Ghats in the Nasik district of Maharashtra. Its length is about 1500 km . It drains into the Bay of Bengal. Its drainage basin is also the largest among the peninsular rivers. The basin covers parts of Maharashtra (about 50 per cent of the basin area lies in Maharashtra), Madhya Pradesh, Odisha and Andhra Pradesh. The Godavari is joined by a number of tributaries, such as the Purna, the Wardha, the Pranhita, the Manjra, the Wainganga and the Penganga. The last three tributaries are very large. Because of its length and the area it covers, it is also known as the Dakshin Ganga.\n\n## The Mahanadi Basin\n\nThe Mahanadi rises in the highlands of Chhattisgarh. It flows through Odisha to reach",

Its drainage basin is shared by Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, and Odisha.\n\n## The Krishna Basin\n\nRising from a spring near Mahabaleshwar, the Krishna flows for about 1400 km and reaches the Bay of Bengal. The Tungabhadra, the Koyana, the Ghatprabha, the Musi and the Bhima are some of its tributaries. Its drainage basin is shared by Maharasthra, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh.\n\n## The Kaveri Basin\n\nThe Kaveri rises in the Brahmagri range of the Western Ghats and it reaches the Bay of Bengal in south of Cuddalore in Tamil Nadu. The total length of the river is about 760 km . Its main tributaries are Amravati, Bhavani, Hemavati and Kabini. Its basin drains parts of Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu.\nDo You Know? - The river Kaveri makes the second biggest waterfall in India, known as Shivasamudram Falls. The hydroelectric power generated from the falls is supplied to Mysuru, Bengaluru and the Kolar Gold Field.\n\n## Find out\n\n- The name of the biggest waterfall in India.\n\nBesides these major rivers, there are some smaller rivers flowing towards the east. The Damoder, the Brahmani, the Baitarni and the Subarnrekha are some notable examples. Locate them in your atlas.\n\nDo You Know? - 71 per cent of the world's surface is covered with water, but 97 per cent of that is salt water.\n\n- Of the 3 per cent that is available as freshwater, three quarters of it is trapped as ice.\n\n\n## Lakes\n\nYou may be familiar with the valley of Kashmir and the famous Dal Lake, the house boats and shikaras, which attract thousands of tourists every year. Similarly, you may have visited some other tourist spot near a lake and enjoyed boating, swimming and other water games.\n\nImagine that if Srinagar, Nainital and other tourists places did not have a lake would they have been as attractive as they are today? Have you ever tried to know the importance of lakes in making a place attractive to tourists? Apart from attraction for tourists, lakes are also useful to human beings in many ways.\n\n## Find out\n\n- Lakes of large extent are called seas, like the Caspian, the Dead and the Aral seas.\n\nIndia has many lakes. These differ from each other in size and other characteristics. Most lakes are permanent; some contain water only during the rainy season, like the lakes in the basins of inland drainage of semi-arid regions. There are some lakes which are the result of the action of glaciers and ice sheets, while others have been formed by wind, river action and human activities.\n\nA meandering river across a floodplain forms cut-offs that later develops into ox-bow lakes. Spits and bars form lagoons in the coastal areas, e.g. the Chilika lake, the Pulicat lake and the Kolleru lake. Lakes in the region of inland drainage are sometimes seasonal; for example, the Sambhar lake in Rajasthan, which is a salt water lake. Its water is used for producing salt.\n\nMost of the freshwater lakes are in the Himalayan region. They are of glacial origin. In other words, they formed when glaciers dug out a basin, which was later filled with snowmelt. The Wular lake in Jammu and Kashmir, in contrast, is the result of tectonic activity. It is the largest freshwater lake in India. The Dal lake, Bhimtal, Nainital, Loktak and Barapani are some other important freshwater lakes.\n\n\n**[IMAGE: A photo depicting a rural landscape with people working on a bamboo raft in a water body, surrounded by greenery and hills.]**\n\n\n\nFigure 3.6 : Loktak Lake",

A lake helps to regulate the flow of a river. During heavy rains, it prevents flooding and during the dry season, it helps to maintain an even flow of water. Lakes can also be used for developing hydel power. They moderate the climate of the surroundings; maintain the aquatic ecosystem, enhance natural beauty, help develop tourism and provide recreation.\n\n## Role of Rivers in the Economy\n\nRivers have been of fundamental importance throughout the human history. Water from rivers is a basic natural resource, essential for various human activities. Therefore, riverbanks have attracted settlers from ancient times. These settlements have now become big cities. Make a list of cities in your state which are located on the bank of a river.\n\nUsing rivers for irrigation, navigation, hydro-power generation is of special significance - particularly to a country like India, where agriculture is the major source of livelihood of the majority of its population.\n\n## River Pollution\n\nThe growing domestic, municipal, industrial and agricultural demand for water from rivers naturally affects the quality of water.

On the other hand, a heavy load of untreated sewage and industrial effluents are emptied into the rivers. This affects not only the quality of water but also the self-cleansing capacity of the river. For example, given the adequate streamflow, the Ganga water is able to dilute and assimilate pollution loads within 20 km of large cities. But the increasing urbanisation and industrialisation do not allow it to happen and the pollution level of many rivers has been rising. Concern over rising pollution in our rivers led to the launching of various action plans to clean the rivers. Have you heard about such action plans? How does our health get affected by polluted river water? Think about \"life of human beings without fresh water\". Arrange a debate on this topic in the class.\n\n# EXERCISE \n\n1.

These are the two of the three basic elements that one learns about the natural environment of any area. In this chapter you will learn about the third, that is, the atmospheric conditions that prevail over our country. Why do we wear woollens in December or why it is hot and uncomfortable in the month of May, and why it rains in June - July? The answers to all these questions can be found out by studying about the climate of India.\n\n**Climate** refers to the sum total of weather conditions and variations over a large area for a long period of time (more than thirty years). **Weather** refers to the state of the atmosphere over an area at any point of time. The elements of weather and climate are the same, i.e. temperature, atmospheric pressure, wind, humidity and precipitation. You may have observed that the weather conditions fluctuate very often even within a day. But there is some common pattern over a few weeks or months, i.e. days are cool or hot, windy or calm, cloudy or bright, and wet or dry. On the basis of the generalised monthly atmospheric conditions, the year is divided into seasons such as winter, summer or rainy seasons.\n\nThe world is divided into a number of climatic regions. Do you know what type of climate India has and why it is so? We will learn about it in this chapter.\n\n**Do You Know?** - The word monsoon is derived from the Arabic word 'mausim' which literally means season.\n\n- Monsoon refers to the seasonal reversal in the wind direction during a year.\n\nThe climate of India is described as the **'monsoon'** type. In Asia, this type of climate is found mainly in the south and the southeast. Despite an overall unity in the general pattern, there are perceptible regional variations in climatic conditions within the country. Let us take two important elements – temperature and precipitation, and examine how they vary from place to place and season to season.\n\nIn summer, the mercury occasionally touches 50°C in some parts of the Rajasthan desert, whereas it may be around 20°C in Pahalgam in Jammu and Kashmir. On a winter night, temperature at Drass in Jammu and Kashmir may be as low as minus 45°C. Thiruvananthapuram, on the other hand, may have a temperature of 22°C.\n\n**Do You Know?** In certain places there is a wide difference between day and night temperatures. In the Thar Desert the day temperature may rise to 50°C, and drop down to near 15°C the same night. On the other hand, there is hardly any difference in day and night temperatures in the Andaman and Nicobar islands or in Kerala.\n\nLet us now look at precipitation. There are variations not only in the form and types of precipitation but also in its amount and the seasonal distribution. While precipitation is mostly in the form of snowfall in the upper parts of Himalayas, it rains over the rest of the country. The annual precipitation varies from over 400 cm in Meghalaya to less than 10 cm in Ladakh and western Rajasthan. Most parts of the country receive rainfall from June to September. But some parts like the Tamil Nadu",

      "content": "coast gets a large portion of its rain during October and November.\n\nIn general, coastal areas experience less contrasts in temperature conditions. Seasonal contrasts are more in the interior of the country. There is decrease in rainfall generally from east to west in the Northern Plains. These variations have given rise to variety in lives of people - in terms of the food they eat, the clothes they wear and also the kind of houses they live in.\nFind Out\nWhy the houses in Rajasthan have thick walls and flat roofs?\n\n- Why is it that the houses in the Tarai region and in Goa and Mangalore have sloping roofs?\n- Why houses in Assam are built on stilts?\n\n\n## Climatic Controls\n\nThere are six major controls of the climate of any place. They are: latitude, altitude, pressure and wind system, distance from the sea (continentality), ocean currents and relief features.\n\nDue to the curvature of the earth, the amount of solar energy received varies according to latitude. As a result, air temperature generally decreases from the equator towards the poles. As one goes from the surface of the earth to higher altitudes, the atmosphere becomes less dense and temperature decreases. The hills are therefore cooler during summers. The pressure and wind system of any area depend on the latitude and altitude of the place. Thus it influences the temperature and rainfall pattern. The sea exerts a moderating influence on climate: As the distance from the sea increases, its moderating influence decreases and the people experience extreme weather conditions. This condition is known as continentality (i.e. very hot during summers and very cold during winters). Ocean currents along with onshore winds affect the climate of the coastal areas, For example, any coastal area with warm or cold currents flowing past it, will be warmed or cooled if the winds are onshore.\n\nFind Out\n-Why most of the world's deserts are located in the western margins of continents in the subtropics?\n\nFinally, relief too plays a major role in determining the climate of a place. High mountains act as barriers for cold or hot winds; they may also cause precipitation if they are high enough and lie in the path of rain-bearing winds. The leeward side of mountains remains relatively dry.\n\n## Factors Affecting India's Climate\n\n## Latitude\n\nThe Tropic of Cancer passes through the middle of the country from the Rann of Kuchchh in the west to Mizoram in the east. Almost half of the country, lying south of the Tropic of Cancer, belongs to the tropical area. All the remaining area, north of the Tropic, lies in the sub-tropics. Therefore, India's climate has characteristics of tropical as well as subtropical climates.\n\n## Altitude\n\nIndia has mountains to the north, which have an average height of about 6,000 metres. India also has a vast coastal area where the maximum elevation is about 30 metres. The Himalayas prevent the cold winds from Central Asia from entering the subcontinent. It is because of these mountains that this subcontinent experiences comparatively milder winters as compared to central Asia.\n\n## Pressure and Winds\n\nThe climate and associated weather conditions in India are governed by the following atmospheric conditions:\n\n- Pressure and surface winds;\n- Upper air circulation; and\n- Western cyclonic disturbances and tropical cyclones.\nIndia lies in the region of north easterly winds. These winds originate from the subtropical high-pressure belt of the northern",

      "content": "hemisphere. They blow southwards, get deflected to the right due to the Coriolis force, and move towards the equatorial low-pressure area. Generally, these winds carry little moisture as they originate and blow over land. Therefore, they bring little or no rain. Hence, India should have been an arid land, but it is not so. Let us see why?\n\nCoriolis force: An apparent force caused by the earth's rotation. The Coriolis force is responsible for deflecting winds towards the right in the northern hemisphere and towards the left in the southern hemisphere. This is also known as 'Ferrel's Law'.\n\nThe pressure and wind conditions over India are unique. During winter, there is a high-pressure area north of the Himalayas. Cold dry winds blow from this region to the low-pressure areas over the oceans to the south. In summer, a low-pressure area develops over interior Asia, as well as, over northwestern India. This causes a complete reversal of the direction of winds during summer. Air moves from the high-pressure area over the southern Indian Ocean, in a south-easterly direction, crosses the equator, and turns right towards the low-pressure areas over the Indian subcontinent. These are known as the Southwest Monsoon winds. These winds blow over the warm oceans, gather moisture and bring widespread rainfall over the mainland of India.\n\n## The Seasons\n\nThe monsoon type of climate is characterised by a distinct seasonal pattern. The weather conditions greatly change from one season to the other. These changes are particularly noticeable in the interior parts of the country. The coastal areas do not experience much variation in temperature though there is variation in rainfall pattern. How many seasons are experienced in your place? Four main seasons can be identified in India - the cold weather season, the hot weather season, the\nadvancing monsoon and the retreating monsoon with some regional variations.\n\n## The Cold Weather Season (Winter)\n\nThe cold weather season begins from midNovember in northern India and stays till February. December and January are the coldest months in the northern part of India. The temperature decreases from south to the north. The average temperature of Chennai, on the eastern coast, is between $24^{\\circ}-25^{\\circ}$ Celsius, while in the northern plains, it ranges between $10^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ and $15^{\\circ}$ Celsius. Days are warm and nights are cold. Frost is common in the north and the higher slopes of the Himalayas experience snowfall.\n\nDuring this season, the northeast trade winds prevail over the country. They blow from land to sea and hence, for most part of the country, it is a dry season. Some amount of rainfall occurs on the Tamil Nadu coast from these winds as, here they blow from sea to land.\n\nIn the northern part of the country, a feeble high-pressure region develops, with light winds moving outwards from this area. Influenced by the relief, these winds blow through the Ganga valley from the west and the northwest. The weather is normally marked by clear sky, low temperatures and low humidity and feeble, variable winds.\n\nA characteristic feature of the cold weather season over the northern plains is the inflow of cyclonic disturbances from the west and the northwest. These low-pressure systems, originate over the Mediterranean Sea and western Asia and move into India, along with the westerly flow. They cause the much-needed winter rains over the plains and snowfall in the mountains. Although the total amount of winter rainfall locally known as 'mahawat' is small, they are of immense importance for the cultivation of 'rabi' crops.\n\nThe peninsular region does not have a welldefined cold season. There is hardly any noticeable seasonal change in temperature pattern during winters due to the moderating influence of the sea.",

      "content": "## The Hot Weather Season (Summer)\n\nDue to the apparent northward movement of the sun, the global heat belt shifts northwards. As such, from March to May, it is hot weather season in India. The influence of the shifting of the heat belt can be seen clearly from temperature recordings taken during MarchMay at different latitudes. In March, the highest temperature is about $38^{\\circ}$ Celsius, recorded on the Deccan plateau. In April, temperatures in Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh are around $42^{\\circ}$ Celsius. In May, temperature of $45^{\\circ}$ Celsius is common in the northwestern parts of the country. In peninsular India, temperatures remain lower due to the moderating influence of the oceans.\n\nThe summer months experience rising temperature and falling air pressure in the northern part of the country. Towards the end of May, an elongated low-pressure area develops in the region extending from the Thar Desert in the northwest to Patna and Chotanagpur plateau in the east and southeast. Circulation of air begins to set in around this trough.\n\nA striking feature of the hot weather season is the 'loo'. These are strong, gusty, hot, dry winds blowing during the day over the north and northwestern India. Sometimes they even continue until late in the evening. Direct exposure to these winds may even prove to be fatal. Dust storms are very common during the month of May in northern India. These storms bring temporary relief as they lower the temperature and may bring light rain and cool breeze. This is also the season for localised thunderstorms, associated with violent winds, torrential downpours, often accompanied by hail. In West Bengal, these storms are known as the 'Kaal Baisakhi'.\n\nTowards the close of the summer season, pre-monsoon showers are common especially, in Kerala and Karnataka. They help in the early ripening of mangoes, and are often referred to as 'mango showers'.\n\n## Advancing Monsoon (The Rainy Season)\n\nBy early June, the low-pressure condition over the northern plains intensifies. It attracts, the trade winds of the southern hemisphere. These south-east trade winds originate over the warm subtropical areas of the southern oceans. They cross the equator and blow in a southwesterly direction entering the Indian peninsula as the south-west monsoon. As these winds blow over warm oceans, they bring abundant moisture to the subcontinent. These winds are strong and blow at an average velocity of 30 km per hour. With the exception of the extreme north-west, the monsoon winds cover the country in about a month.\n\nThe inflow of the south-west monsoon into India brings about a total change in the weather. Early in the season, the windward side of the Western Ghats receives very heavy rainfall, more than 250 cm . The Deccan Plateau and parts of Madhya Pradesh also receive some amount of rain in spite of lying in the rain shadow area. The maximum rainfall of this season is received in the north-eastern part of the country. Mawsynram in the southern ranges of the Khasi Hills receives the highest average rainfall in the world. Rainfall in the Ganga valley decreases from the east to the west. Rajasthan and parts of Gujarat get scanty rainfall.\n\nAnother phenomenon associated with the monsoon is its tendency to have 'breaks' in rainfall. Thus, it has wet and dry spells. In other words, the monsoon rains take place only for a few days at a time. They are interspersed with rainless intervals. These breaks in monsoon are related to the movement of the monsoon trough. For various reasons, the trough and its axis keep on moving northward or southward, which determines the spatial distribution of rainfall. When the axis of the monsoon trough lies over the plains, rainfall is good in these parts. On the other hand, whenever the axis shifts closer to the Himalayas, there are longer dry spells in the plains, and widespread rain occur in the mountainous catchment areas of the Himalayan rivers. These heavy rains bring in",

The frequency and intensity of tropical depressions too, determine the amount and duration of monsoon rains. These depressions form at the head of the Bay of Bengal and cross over to the mainland.

While it causes heavy floods in one part, it may be responsible for droughts in the other. It is often irregular in its arrival and its retreat. Hence, it sometimes disturbs the farming schedule of millions of farmers all over the country.\n\n## Retreating/Post Monsoons (The Transition Season)\n\nDuring October-November, with the apparent movement of the sun towards the south, the monsoon trough or the low-pressure trough over the northern plains becomes weaker. This is gradually replaced by a high-pressure system. The south-west monsoon winds weaken and start withdrawing gradually. By the beginning of October, the monsoon withdraws from the Northern Plains.\n\nThe months of October-November form a period of transition from hot rainy season to dry winter conditions. The retreat of the monsoon is marked by clear skies and rise in\n\nDo You Know? Mawsynram, the wettest place on the earth is also reputed for its stalagmite and stalactite caves.\ntemperature. While day temperatures are high, nights are cool and pleasant. The land is still moist. Owing to the conditions of high temperature and humidity, the weather becomes rather oppressive during the day. This is commonly known as 'October heat'. In the second half of October, the mercury begins to fall rapidly in northern India.\n\nThe low-pressure conditions, over northwestern India, get transferred to the Bay of Bengal by early November. This shift is associated with the occurrence of cyclonic depressions, which originate over the Andaman Sea. These cyclones generally cross the eastern coasts of India cause heavy and widespread rain. These tropical cyclones are often very destructive. The thickly populated deltas of the Godavari, the Krishna and the Kaveri are frequently struck by cyclones, which cause great damage to life and property. Sometimes, these cyclones arrive at the coasts of Odisha, West Bengal and Bangladesh. The bulk of the rainfall of the Coromandel Coast is derived from depressions and cyclones.\n\n## Distribution of Rainfall\n\nParts of western coast and northeastern India receive over about 400 cm of rainfall annually. However, it is less than 60 cm in western Rajasthan and adjoining parts of Gujarat, Haryana and Punjab. Rainfall is equally low in the interior of the Deccan plateau, and east of the Sahyadris. Why do these regions receive low rainfall? A third area of low precipitation is around Leh in Jammu and Kashmir. The rest of the country receives moderate rainfall. Snowfall is restricted to the Himalayan region.\n\nOwing to the nature of monsoons, the annual rainfall is highly variable from year to year. Variability is high in the regions of low rainfall, such as parts of Rajasthan, Gujarat and the leeward side of the Western Ghats. As such, while areas of high rainfall are liable to be affected by floods, areas of low rainfall are drought-prone (Figure 4.3).\n\n## Monsoon as a Unifying Bond\n\nYou have already known the way the Himalayas protect the subcontinent from extremely cold winds from central Asia. This enables northern India to have uniformly higher temperatures compared to other areas on the same latitudes. Similarly, the Peninsular plateau, under the influence of the sea from three sides, has moderate temperatures. Despite such",

By night, the city and its people were defeated. No transport, no electricity and no place to go. Mumbai was on its knees.\n\nThe weather bureau had predicted just another \"normal\" rainy day for the city. But it poured 944.2 m.m. (three feet of rain) over 24 hours, the highest in 100 years.\n\nBefore 26-7, Mumbaiites, used to about 15 cm of rain, would lease. \"What's a Mumbai monsoon without some days of disruption?\" On 26-7, the joke was on them.\n\nThe rain picked up at about 1 p.m. initially, nobody paid attention.

Give reasons as to why.\n(i) Seasonal reversal of wind direction takes place over the Indian subcontinent?\n(ii) The bulk of rainfall in India is concentrated over a few months.\n(iii) The Tamil Nadu coast receives winter rainfall.\n(iv) The delta region of the eastern coast is frequently struck by cyclones.\n(v) Parts of Rajasthan, Gujarat and the leeward side of the Western Ghats are drought-prone.\n5. Describe the regional variations in the climatic conditions of India with the help of suitable examples.\n6. Give an account of weather conditions and characteristics of the cold season.\n7. Give the characteristics and effects of the monsoon rainfall in India.\n\n# Map Skills \n\nOn an outline map of India, show the following.\n(i) Areas receiving rainfall over 400 cm .\n(ii) Areas receiving less than 20 cm of rainfall.\n(iii) The direction of the south-west monsoon over India.\n\n## Project/Activity\n\n(i) Find out which songs, dances, festivals and special food preparations are associated with certain seasons in your region. Do they have some commonality with other regions of India?\n(ii) Collect photographs of typical rural houses, and clothing of people from different regions of India. Examine whether they reflect any relationship with the climatic condition and relief of the area.\n\n## FOR DOING IT YOURSELF\n\n1. In Table-I, the average mean monthly temperatures and amounts of rainfall of 10 representative stations have been given. It is for you to study on your own and convert them into 'temperature and rainfall' graphs. A glance at these visual representations will help you to grasp instantly the similarities and differences between them. One such graph (Figure 1) is already prepared for you. See if you can arrive at some broad generalisations about our diverse climatic conditions. We hope you are in for a great joy of learning. Do the following activities.\n2. Re-arrange the 10 stations in two different sequences:\n\nFigure 1 : Temperature and Rainfall of Delhi\n\n\n**[IMAGE: A chart showing the temperature and rainfall in Delhi throughout the year.]**\n\n",

Are they similar or there are variations? India being a vast country you can imagine the types of bio-forms available throughout the country.\n\nOur country India is one of the 12 mega bio-diversity countries of the world. With about 47,000 plant species India occupies tenth place in the world and fourth in Asia in plant diversity. There are about 15,000 flowering plants in India, which account for 6 per cent in the world's total number of flowering plants. The country has many nonflowering plants, such as ferns, algae and fungi. India also has approximately 90,000 species of animals, as well as, a rich variety of fish in its fresh and marine waters.\n\nNatural vegetation refers to a plant community, which has grown naturally without human aid and has been left undisturbed by humans for a long time. This is termed as a virgin vegetation. Thus, cultivated crops and fruits, orchards form part of vegetation but not natural vegetation.\n\n## Do You Know?\n\nThe virgin vegetation, which are purely Indian are known as endemic or indigenous species but those which have come from outside India are termed as exotic plants.\n\nThe term flora is used to denote plants of a particular region or period. Similarly, the species of animals are referred to as fauna.\n\n## Types of Vegetation\n\nThe following major types of vegetation may be identified in our country (Figure 5.4).\n(i) Tropical Evergreen Forests\n(ii) Tropical Deciduous Forests\n(iii) Tropical Thorn Forests and Scrubs\n(iv) Montane Forests\n(v) Mangrove Forests\n\n\n**[IMAGE: A diagram illustrating the different layers of a forest ecosystem, including the emergent layer, canopy layer, young trees, shrubs layer, and ground layer with their respective heights.]**\n\n\n\nFigure 5.1 : Tropical Evergreen Forest",

      "content": "## Tropical Evergreen Forests\n\nThese forests are restricted to heavy rainfall areas of the Western Ghats and the island groups of Lakshadweep, Andaman and Nicobar, upper parts of Assam and Tamil Nadu coast. They are at their best in areas having more than 200 cm of rainfall with a short dry season. The trees reach great heights up to 60 metres or even above. Since the region is warm and wet throughout the year, it has a luxuriant vegetation of all kinds - trees, shrubs and creepers giving it a multilayered structure. There is no definite time for trees to shed their leaves. As such, these forests appear green all the year round.\n\nSome of the commercially important trees of this forest are ebony, mahogany, rosewood, rubber and cinchona.\n\nThe common animals found in these forests are elephant, monkey, lemur and deer. Onehorned rhinoceroses are found in the jungles of Assam and West Bengal. Besides these animals, plenty of birds, bats, sloth, scorpions and snails are also found in these jungles.\n\n## Tropical Deciduous Forests\n\nThese are the most widespread forests of India. They are also called the monsoon forests and spread over the region receiving rainfall between 200 cm and 70 cm . Trees of this forest\n\n\n**[IMAGE: An illustration of a forest with various types of trees.]**\n\n\n\nFigure 5.2 : Tropical Deciduous Forest\ntype shed their leaves for about six to eight weeks in dry summer.\n\nOn the basis of the availability of water, these forests are further divided into moist and dry deciduous. The former is found in areas receiving rainfall between 200 and 100 cm . These forests exist, therefore, mostly in the eastern part of the country - northeastern states, along the foothills of the Himalayas, Jharkhand, West Odisha and Chhattisgarh, and on the eastern slopes of the Western Ghats. Teak is the most dominant species of this forest. Bamboos, sal, shisham, sandalwood, khair, kusum, arjun and mulberry are other commercially important species.\n\nThe dry deciduous forests are found in areas having rainfall between 100 cm and 70 cm . These forests are found in the rainier parts of the Peninsular plateau and the plains of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. There are open stretches, in which teak, sal, peepal and neem grow. A large part of this region has been cleared for cultivation and some parts are used for grazing.\n\nIn these forests, the common animals found are lion, tiger, pig, deer and elephant. A huge variety of birds, lizards, snakes and tortoises are also found here.\n\n## The Thorn Forests and Scrubs\n\nIn regions with less than 70 cm of rainfall, the natural vegetation consists of thorny trees and\n\n\n**[IMAGE: A diagram illustrating desert vegetation with trees and cacti.]**\n\n\n\nFigure 5.3 : Thorn Forests and Scrubs",

This type of vegetation is found in the north-western part of the country, including semi-arid areas of Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana. Acacias, palms, euphorbias and cacti are the main plant species. Trees are scattered and have long roots penetrating deep into the soil in order to get moisture. The stems are succulent to conserve water. Leaves are mostly thick and small to minimise evaporation. These forests give way to thorn forests and scrubs in arid areas.\n\nIn these forests, the common animals are rats, mice, rabbits, fox, wolf, tiger, lion, wild ass, horses and camels.\n\n## Montane Forests\n\nIn mountainous areas, the decrease in temperature with increasing altitude leads to the corresponding change in natural vegetation. As such, there is a succession of natural vegetation belts in the same order as we see from the tropical to the tundra region. The wet temperate type of forests are found between a height of 1000 and 2000 metres. Evergreen broad-leaf trees, such as oaks and chestnuts predominate. Between 1500 and 3000 metres, temperate forests containing\n\n\n**[IMAGE: A diagram showing different types of trees in a forest ecosystem.]**\n\n\n\nFigure 5.5 : Montane Forests\nconiferous trees, like pine, deodar, silver fir, spruce and cedar, are found. These forests cover mostly the southern slopes of the Himalayas, places having high altitude in southern and north-east India. At higher elevations, temperate grasslands are common. At high altitudes, generally, more than 3,600 metres above the sea level, temperate forests and grasslands give way to the Alpine vegetation. Silver fir, junipers, pines and birches are the common trees of these forests. However, they get progressively stunted as they approach the snow-line. Ultimately, through shrubs and scrubs, they merge into the Alpine grasslands. These are used extensively for grazing by nomadic tribes, like the Gujjars and the Bakarwals. At higher altitudes, mosses and lichens form part of tundra vegetation.\n\nThe common animals found in these forests are Kashmir stag, spotted dear, wild sheep, jack rabbit, Tibetan antelope, yak, snow leopard, squirrels, Shaggy horn wild ibex, bear and rare red panda, sheep and goats with thick hair.\n\n## Mangrove Forests\n\nThe mangrove tidal forests are found in the areas of coasts influenced by tides. Mud and silt get accumutated on such coasts. Dense\n\n\n**[IMAGE: A diagram illustrating the root system of a mangrove tree extending into the water.]**\n\n\n\nFigure 5.6 : Mangrove Forests",

Some 2,000 plants have been described in Ayurveda and at least 500 are in regular use. The World Conservation Union's Red List has named 352 medicinal plants of which 52 are critically threatened and 49 endangered. The commonly used plants in India are:\n\nSarpagandha : Used to treat blood pressure; it is found only in India.\nJamun : The juice from ripe fruit is used to prepare vinegar, which is carminative and diuretic, and has digestive properties. The powder of the seed is used for controlling diabetes.\nArjun : The fresh juice of leaves is a cure for earache. It is also used to regulate blood pressure.\nBabool : Leaves are used as a cure for eye sores. Its gum is used as a tonic.\nNeem : Has high antibiotic and antibacterial properties.\nTulsi : Is used to cure cough and cold.\nKachnar : Is used to cure asthma and ulcers. The buds and roots are good for digestive problems.\nIdentify more medicinal plants in your area.

As has been mentioned earlier due to excessive exploitation of plant and animal resources by human beings, the ecosystem has been disturbed. About 1,300 plant species are endangered and 20 species are extinct. Quite a few animal species are also endangered and some have become extinct.\n\nThe main causes for this major threat to nature are hunting by greedy hunters for commercial purposes. Pollution due to chemical and industrial waste, acid deposits, introduction of alien species and reckless cutting of the forests to bring land under cultivation and habitation, are also responsible for the imbalance.\n\nTo protect the flora and fauna of the country, the government has taken many steps.\n(i) Eighteen biosphere reserves have been set up in the country to protect flora and fauna. Twelve out of these, the Sundarbans Nanda Devi, the Gulf of Mannar, the Nilgiri, Nokrek, Great Nicobar, Simlipal, Pachmarhi, Achanakmar-Amarkantak, Agasthyamalai, Kangchendzonga and Panna have been included in the world network of biosphere reserves.\n\n## Eighteen Bio-reserves\n\n- Sundarbans\n- Simlipal\n- Gulf of Mannar\n- Dihang-Dibang\n- Nilgiri\n- Dibru Saikhowa\n- Nanda Devi\n- Agasthyamalai\n- Nokrek\n- Kangchendzonga\n- Great Nicobar\n- Pachmarhi\n- Manas\n- Achanakmar-Amarkantak\n- Kachchh\n- Cold Desert\n- Seshachalam\n- Panna\n(ii) Financial and technical assistance is provided to many botanical gardens by the government since 1992.\n(iii) Project Tiger, Project Rhino, Project Great Indian Bustard and many other eco-developmental projects have been introduced.\n(iv) 106 National Parks, 573 Wildlife sanctuaries and Zoological gardens are set up to take care of natural heritage.\n\nAll of us must realise the importance of the natural ecosystem for our own survival. It is possible if indiscriminate destruction of natural environment is put to an immediate end.\n\n# Migratory Birds \n\nSome of the wetlands of India are popular with migratory birds. During winter, birds, such as Siberian Crane, come in large numbers. One such place favourable with birds is the Rann of Kachchh. At a place where the desert merges with the sea, flamingo with their brilliant pink plumage come in thousands to build nest mounds from the salty mud and raise their young ones. It is one among many extraordinary sights in the country. Is it not a rich natural heritage of ours?\n\n\n**[IMAGE: A group of birds, likely egrets, in a wetland area.]**\n\n",

      "content": "# Population Size and Distribution \n\n## India's Population Size and Distribution by Numbers\n\nCen you imagine a world without human beings? Who would have utilised the resources and created social and cultural environment? The people are important to develop the economy and the society. The people make and use resources and are themselves resources with varying quality. Coal is but a piece of rock, until people were able to invent technology to obtain it and make it 'resource'. Natural events, like a flood or a Tsunami, becomes a 'disaster' only when they affect a crowded village or a town.\n\nHence, population is the pivotal element in social studies. It is the point of reference from which all other elements are observed and from which they derive significance and meaning. 'Resources', 'calamities' and 'disasters' are all meaningful only in relation to human beings. Their numbers, distribution, growth and characteristics or qualities provide the basic background for understanding and appreciating all aspects of the environment.\n\nHuman beings are producers and consumers of earth's resources. Therefore, it is important to know how many people are there in a country, where do they live, how and why their numbers are increasing and what are their characteristics. The census of India provides us with information regarding the population of our country.\n\nIndia's population as on March 2011 stood at 1,210.6 million, which account for more the 17 per cent of the world's population. These 1.21 billion people are unevenly distributed over our country's vast area of 3.28 million square km , which accounts for 2.4 per cent of the world's area (Figure 6.1).\n\nThe 2011 Census data reveal that Uttar Pradesh with a population size of 199 million is the most populous state of India. Uttar Pradesh accounts for about 16 per cent of the country's population. On the other hand, the Himalayan state of Sikkim has a population of just about 0.6 million and Lakshadweep has only 64,429 people.\n\nAlmost half of India's population lives in just five states. These are Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Bihar, West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh. Rajasthan, the biggest state in terms of area, has only 5.5 per cent of the total population of India (Figure 6.2)\n\nFind out $\\cdot$ What could be the reason of uneven distribution of population in India?\n\n## Census\n\nA census is an official enumeration of population done periodically. In India, the first census was held in the year 1872. The first complete census, however, was taken in the year 1881. Since then, censuses have been held regularly every tenth year.\n\nThe Indian Census is the most comprehensive source of demographic, social and economic data. Have you ever seen a census report? Check in your library if it has one.",

Do you find any corelation between these maps?\n\nNote the States with population densities below 250 persons per square km. Rugged terrain and unfavourable climatic conditions are primarily responsible for sparse population in these areas. Which states have density below 250 persons per square km ?\n\nAssam and most of the Peninsular states have moderate population densities. Hilly, dissected and rocky nature of the terrain, moderate to low rainfall, shallow and less fertile soils have influenced population densities in these areas.\n\nThe Northern plains and Kerala in the south have high to very high population densities because of the flat plains with fertile soils and abundant rainfall. Identify the three states of the Northern Plains with high population densities.\n\n## Population Growth and Processes of Population Change\n\nPopulation is a dynamic phenomenon. The numbers, distribution and composition of the population are constantly changing. This is the influence of the interaction of the three processes, namely - births, deaths and migrations.\n\n## Population Growth\n\nGrowth of population refers to the change in the number of inhabitants of a country/territory during a specific period of time, say during the last 10 years. Such a change can be expressed in two ways: in terms of absolute numbers and in terms of percentage change per year.\n\nThe absolute numbers added each year or decade is the magnitude of increase. It is obtained by simply subtracting the earlier population (e.g. that of 2001) from the later population (e.g. that of 2011). It is referred to as the absolute increase.\n\nThe rate or the pace of population increase is the other important aspect. It is studied in per cent per annum, e.g. a rate of increase of\n\n2 per cent per annum means that in a given year, there was an increase of two persons for every 100 persons in the base population. This is referred to as the annual growth rate.\n\nIndia's population has been steadily increasing from 361 million in 1951 to 1210 million in 2011.\n\nTable 6.1 : The Magnitude and Rate of India's Population Growth\n\n|  Year | Total\nPopulation\n(in million) | Absolute\nIncrease in\nthe Decade\n(in million) | Annual\nGrowth\nRate\n(\\%)  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  1951 | 361.0 | 42.43 | 1.25  |\n|  1961 | 439.2 | 78.15 | 1.96  |\n|  1971 | 548.2 | 108.92 | 2.20  |\n|  1981 | 683.3 | 135.17 | 2.22  |\n|  1991 | 846.4 | 163.09 | 2.16  |\n|  2001 | 1028.7 | 182.32 | 1.97  |\n|  2011 | 1210.6 | 181.46 | 1.64  |\n\nTable 6.1 and Figures 6.4 (a) and 6.4 (b) reveal that from 1951 to 1981, the annual rate of population growth was steadily increasing; which explains the rapid increase in population from 361 million in 1951 to 683 million in 1981.\n\n## Find out\n\n- Table 6.1 reveals that despite the decline in growth rates, the number of people being added every decade is steadily increasing. Why?\n\nSince 1981, however, the rate of growth started declining gradually. During this period, birth rates declined rapidly. Still 182 million people were added to the total population in the 1990s alone (an annual addition larger than ever before).\n\nIt is essential to realise that India has a very large population. When a low annual rate is applied to a very large population, it yields a large absolute increase. When more than a billion people increase even at a lower rate, the total number being added becomes very large. India's annual increase in population is large enough to neutralise efforts to conserve the resource endowment and environment.\n\nThe declining trend of the growth rate is indeed a positive indicator of the efforts of birth control. Despite that, the total additions to the population base continue to grow, and India",

      "content": "Death rate is the number of deaths per thousand persons in a year. The main cause of the rate of growth of the Indian population has been the rapid decline in death rates.\n\nTill 1980, high birth rates and declining death rates led to a large difference between birth rates and death rates resulting in higher rates of population growth. Since 1981, birth rates have also started declining gradually, resulting in a gradual decline in the rate of population growth. What are the reasons for this trend?\n\nThe third component of population growth is migration. Migration is the movement of people across regions and territories. Migration can be internal (within the country) or international (between the countries).\n\nInternal migration does not change the size of the population, but influences the distribution of population within the nation. Migration plays a very significant role in changing the composition and distribution of population.\n\n## Activity\n\nOn a map, trace the migration of each of your grandparents and parents since their birth. Try and analyse the reasons for each move.\n\nIn India, most migrations have been from rural to urban areas because of the \"push\" factor in rural areas. These are adverse conditions of poverty and unemployment in the rural areas and the \"pull\" of the city in terms of increased employment opportunities and better living conditions.\n\nMigration is an important determinant of population change. It changes not only the population size but also the population composition of urban and rural populations in terms of age and sex composition. In India, the rural-urban migration has resulted in a steady increase in the percentage of population in cities and towns. The urban population has increased from 17.29 per cent of the total\npopulation in 1951 to 31.80 per cent in 2011. There has been a significant increase in the number of 'million plus cities' from 35 to 53 in just one decade, i.e., 2001 to 2011. In 2023 there were 59 million plus cities in India.\n\n## Adolescent Population\n\nThe most significant feature of the Indian population is the size of its adolescent population. It constitutes one-fifth of the total population of India. Adolescents are, generally, grouped in the age group of 10 to 19 years. They are the most important resource for the future. Nutrition requirements of adolescents are higher than those of a normal child or adult. Poor nutrition can lead to deficiency and stunted growth. But in India, the diet available to adolescents is inadequate in all nutrients. A large number of adolescent girls suffer from anaemia. Their problems have so far not received adequate attention in the process of development. The adolescent girls have to be sensitised to the problems they confront. Awareness among them can be improved through the spread of literacy and education.\n\n## National Population Policy\n\nRecognising that the planning of families would improve individual health and welfare, the Government of India initiated a comprehensive Family Planning Programme in 1952. The Family Welfare Programme has sought to promote responsible and planned parenthood on a voluntary basis. The National Population Policy (NPP) 2000 is a culmination of years of planned efforts.\n\nThe NPP 2000 provides a policy framework for imparting free and compulsory school education up to 14 years of age, reducing infant mortality rate to below 30 per 1000 live births, achieving universal immunisation of children against all vaccine preventable diseases, promoting delayed marriage for girls, and making family welfare a people-centred programme.",
