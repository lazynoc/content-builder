      "content": "You must have seen and used various forms of data. For example, at the end of almost every news bulletin on Television, the temperatures recorded on that day in major cities are displayed. Similarly, the books on the Geography of India show data relating to the growth and distribution of population, and the production, distribution and trade of various crops, minerals and industrial products in tabular form. Have you ever thought what they mean? From where these data are obtained? How are they tabulated and processed to extract meaningful information from them? In this chapter, we will deliberate on these aspects of the data and try to answer these many questions.\n\n# What is Data? \n\nThe data are defined as numbers that represent measurements from the real world. Datum is a single measurement. We often read the news like 20 centimetres of continuous rain in Barmer or 35 centimetres of rain at a stretch in Banswara in 24 hours or information such as New Delhi - Mumbai distance via Kota Vadodara is 1385 kilometres and via Itarsi - Manmad is 1542 kilometres by train. This numerical information is called data. It may be easily realised that there are large volume of data available around the world today. However, at times, it becomes difficult to derive logical conclusions from these data if they are in raw form. Hence, it is important to ensure that the measured information is algorithmically derived and/or logically deduced and/or statistically calculated from multiple data. Information is defined as either a meaningful answer to a query or a meaningful stimulus that can cascade into further queries.\n\n## Need of Data\n\nMaps are important tools in studying geography. Besides, the distribution and growth of phenomena are also explained through the data in tabular form. We know that an interrelationship exists between many phenomena over the surface of the earth. These interactions are influenced by many variables which can be",

      "content": "explained best in quantitative terms. Statistical analysis of those variables has become a necessity today. For example, to study cropping pattern of an area, it is necessary to have statistical information about the cropped area, crop yield and production, irrigated area, amount of rainfall and inputs like use of fertiliser, insecticides, pesticides, etc. Similarly, data related to the total population, density, number of migrants, occupation of people, their salaries, industries, means of transportation and communication is needed to study the growth of a city. Thus, data plays an important role in geographical analysis.\n\n# Presentation of the Data \n\nYou might have heard the story of a person who was travelling with his wife and a five-year old child. On his way, he had to cross a river. Firstly, he fathomed the depth of the river at four points as $0.6,0.8,0.9$ and 1.5 metres. He calculated the average depth as 0.95 metres. His child's height was 1 metre. So, he led them to cross the river and his child drowned in the river. On the other bank, he sat pondering: \"Lekha Jokha Thahe, to Bachha Dooba Kahe?\" (Why did the child drown when average depth was within the reach of each one?). This is called statistical fallacy, which may deviate you from the real situation. So, it is important to collect the data to know the facts and figures, but equally important is the presentation of data. Today, the use of statistical methods in the analysis, presentation and in drawing conclusions plays a significant role in almost all disciplines, including geography, which use the data. It may, therefore, be inferred that the concentration of a phenomenon, e.g., population, forest or network of transportation or communication not only vary over space and time but may also be conveniently explained using the data. In other words, you may say that there is a shift from qualitative description to quantitative analysis in explaining the relationship among variables. Hence, analytical tools and techniques have become more important these days to make the study more logical and derive precise conclusion. Precise quantitative techniques are used right from the beginning of collecting and compiling data to its tabulation, organisation, ordering and analysis till the derivation of conclusions.\n\n## Sources of Data\n\nThe data are collected through the following ways. These are : 1. Primary Sources, and 2. Secondary Sources.\n\nThe data which are collected for the first time by an individual or the group of individuals, institution/organisations are called Primary sources of the data. On the other hand, data collected from any published or unpublished sources are called Secondary sources. Fig. 1.1 shows the different methods of data collection.\n\n## Sources of Primary Data\n\n## 1. Personal Observations\n\nIt refers to the collection of information by an individual or group of individuals through direct observations in the field. Through a field survey, information about the relief features, drainage patterns, types of soil and natural vegetation, as well as, population structure, sex ratio, literacy, means of transport and communication, urban and rural settlements, etc., is collected.

Questionnaire/Schedule \n\nIn this method, simple questions and their possible answers are written on a plain paper and the respondents have to tick-mark the possible answers from the given choices. At times, a set of structured questions are written and sufficient space is provided in the questionnaire where the respondent write their opinion. The objectives of the survey should be clearly mentioned in the questionnaire. This method is useful in carrying out the survey of a larger area. Even questionnaire can be mailed to far-flung places. The limitation of the method is that only the literate and educated people can be approached to provide the required information. Similar to the questionnaire that contains the questions pertaining to the matter of investigation is the schedule. The only difference between the questionnaire and the schedule is that the respondent himself/ herself fills up the questionnaires, whereas, a properly trained enumerator himself fills up schedules by asking question addressed to the respondents. The main advantage of schedule over the questionnaire is that the information from both literate and illiterate respondents can be collected.\n\n## 4. Other Methods\n\nThe data about the properties of soil and water are collected directly in the field by measuring their characteristics using soil kit and water quality kit. Similarly, field scientists collect data about the health of the crops and vegetation using transducers (Fig. 1.2).\n\n## Secondary Source of Data\n\nSecondary sources of data consist of published and unpublished records which include government publications, documents and reports.\n\nPublished Sources\n\n## 1. Government Publications\n\nThe publications of the various ministries and the departments of the Government of India, state governments and the District Bulletins are one of the most important sources of secondary information. These include the Census of India published by the Office of the Registrar General of India, reports of the National Sample Survey, Weather Reports of Indian Meteorological Department and Statistical Abstracts published by state governments, and the periodical reports published by different Commissions. Some of the government publications are shown in Fig. 1.3.\n\n\n**[IMAGE: A person using a surveying instrument in a field.]**\n\n\n\nFig. 1.2 : Field Scientist taking Measures of Crop Health\n\n\n**[IMAGE: Image showing three reference books: District Gazetteer, National Atlas of India Volume II, and Provisional Population Totals.]**\n\n\n\nFig. 1.3 : Some of the Government Publications",

Private Documents \n\nThese include unpublished reports and records of companies, trade unions, different political and apolitical organisations and residents' welfare associations.\n\n## Tabulation and Classification of Data\n\nThe data collected from primary or secondary sources initially appear as a big jumble of information with the least of comprehension. This is known as raw data. To draw meaningful inferences and to make them usable the raw data requires tabulation and classification.\n\nOne of the simplest devices to summarise and present the data is the Statistical Table. It is a systematic arrangement of data in columns and rows. The purpose of table is to simplify the presentation and to facilitate comparisons. This table enables the reader to locate the desired information quickly. Thus, the tables make it possible for the analyst to present a huge mass of data in an orderly manner within a minimum of space.\n\n## Data Compilation and Presentation\n\nData are collected, tabulated and presented in a tabular form either in absolute terms, percentages or indices.\n\n## Absolute Data\n\nWhen data are presented in their original form as integers, they are called absolute data or raw data. For example, the total population of a country or a state, the total production of a crop or a manufacturing industry, etc. Table 1.1 shows the absolute data of population of India and some of the selected states.\n\nTable 1.1 : Population of India and Selected States/Union Territories, 2011\n\n| State/ <br> UT Code | India/State/ <br> Union Territory | Total Population |  |  |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n|  |  | Persons | Males | Females |\n| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |\n| 1. | INDIA ${ }^{1}$ | 1,21,05,69,573 | 62,31,21,843 | 58,74,47,730 |\n|  | Jammu and Kashmir ${ }^{2}$ | $1,25,41,302$ | $66,40,662$ | $59,00,640$ |\n| 2. | Himachal Pradesh | $68,64,602$ | $34,81,873$ | $33,82,729$ |\n| 3. | Punjab | $2,77,43,338$ | $1,46,39,465$ | $1,31,03,873$ |\n| 4. | Chandigarh ${ }^{3}$ | $10,55,450$ | $5,80,663$ | $4,74,787$ |\n| 5. | Uttarakhand | $1,00,86,292$ | $51,37,773$ | $49,48,519$ |\n| 6. | Haryana | $2,53,51,462$ | $1,34,94,734$ | $1,18,56,728$ |\n| 7. | National Capital | $1,67,87,941$ | 89,87,326 | 78,00,615 |\n|  | Territory of Delhi |  |  |  |\n| 8. | Rajasthan | $6,85,48,437$ | $3,55,50,997$ | $3,29,97,440$ |\n| 9. | Uttar Pradesh | $19,98,12,341$ | $10,44,80,510$ | $9,53,31,831$ |\n| 10. | Bihar | $10,40,99,452$ | $5,42,78,157$ | $4,98,21,295$ |\n\n[^0]Source : Census, 2011\n\n## Percentage/Ratio\n\nSome time data are tabulated in a ratio or percentage form that are computed from a common parameter, such as literacy rate or growth rate of population, percentage of agricultural products or industrial products, etc. Table 1.2 presents\n\n\n[^0]:    ${ }^{1}$ inclusive of all territorial boundary of India\n    ${ }^{2}$ excluding PoK\n    ${ }^{3}$ Union Territory",

Literacy rate is calculated as :\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\text { Total Literates }}{\\text { Total Population }} \\times 100\n$$\n\n## Index Number\n\nAn index number is a statistical measure designed to show changes in variable or a group of related variables\n\nTable 1.2 : Literacy Rate : 1951 - 2011\n\n| Year | Person | Male | Female |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| 1951 | 18.33 | 27.16 | 8.86 |\n| 1961 | 28.3 | 40.4 | 15.35 |\n| 1971 | 34.45 | 45.96 | 21.97 |\n| 1981 | 43.57 | 56.38 | 29.76 |\n| 1991 | 52.21 | 64.13 | 39.29 |\n| 2001 | 64.84 | 75.85 | 54.16 |\n| 2011 | 73.0 | 80.9 | 64.6 |\n\nSource: Census, 2011\nwith respect to time, geographic location or other characteristics. It is to be noted that index numbers not only measure changes over a period of time but also compare economic conditions of different locations, industries, cities or countries. Index number is widely used in economics and business to see changes in price and quantity. There are various methods for the calculation of index number. However, the simple aggregate method is most commonly used. It is obtained using the following formula:\n\n$$\n\\sum q_{1} \\times 100\n$$\n\n$\\sum q_{1}=$ Total of the current year production\n$\\sum q_{0}=$ Total of the base year production\nGenerally, base year values are taken as 100 and index number is calculated thereupon. For example, Table 1.3 shows the production of iron ore in India and the changes in index number from 1970-71 to 2000-01 taking 1970-71 as the base year.\n\nTable 1.3 : Production of Iron Ore in India\n\n|  | Production <br> (in million tonnes) | Calculation | Index Number |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| $1970-71$ | 32.5 | $\\frac{32.5}{32.5} \\times 100$ | 100 |\n| $1980-81$ | 42.2 | $\\frac{42.2}{32.5} \\times 100$ | 130 |\n| $1990-91$ | 53.7 | $\\frac{53.7}{32.5} \\times 100$ | 165 |\n| $2000-01$ | 67.4 | $\\frac{67.4}{32.5} \\times 100$ | 207 |\n\nSource - India: Economic Year Book, 2005\n\n# Processing of Data \n\nThe processing of raw data requires their tabulation and classification in selected classes. For example, the data given in Table 1.4 can be used to understand how they are processed.\n\nWe can see that the given data are ungrouped. Hence, the first step is to group data in order to reduce its volume and make it easy to understand.",

The selection of the class interval and the number of classes, however, depends upon the range of raw data. The raw data given in Table 1.4 ranges from 02 to 96 . We can, therefore, conveniently choose to group the data into ten classes with an interval of ten units in each group, e.g. $0-10,10-20,20-30$, etc. (Table 1.5).\n\nTable 1.5 : Making Tally Marks to Obtain Frequency\n\n| Group | Numerical of Raw Data | Tally Marks | Number of Individual |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| $0-10$ | 02,02,09,06 | //// | 4 |\n| $10-20$ | 10,15,18,12,17 | TttL | 5 |\n| 20-30 | 22,28,26,22,28 | TttL | 5 |\n| 30-40 | 39,32,37,36,35,37,31 | TttL// | 7 |\n| 40-50 | 47,46,44,43,42,41 | TttL/ | 6 |\n| 50-60 | $\\begin{aligned} & 53,57,50,51,58 \\\\ & 59,56,58,56,59 \\end{aligned}$ | tttL tttL | 10 |\n| 60-70 | $\\begin{aligned} & 64,62,67,65 \\\\ & 63,64,68,64 \\end{aligned}$ | TttL /// | 8 |\n| 70-80 | 74,73,75,70,74,71 | TttL / | 6 |\n| 80-90 | 89,84,84,80,83 | TttL | 5 |\n| 90-100 | 96,92,90,90 | //// | 4 |\n|  |  |  | $\\sum f=N=60$ |\n\n## Process of Classification\n\nOnce the number of groups and the class interval of each group are determined, the raw data are classified as shown in Table 1.5. It is done by a method popularly known as Four and Cross Method or tally marks.\n\nFirst of all, one tally mark is assigned to each individual in the group in which it is falling. For example, the first numerical in the raw data is 47 . Since, it falls in the group of $40-50$, one tally mark is recorded in the column 3 of Table 1.5.\n\n## Frequency Distribution\n\nIn Table 1.5 we have classified the raw data of a quantitative variable and have grouped them class-wise. The number of individuals (places in the fourth column of Table 1.5) is known as frequency and the column represents the frequency",

Frequencies are classified as Simple and Cumulative frequencies.\n\n## Simple Frequencies\n\nIt is expressed by $\\boldsymbol{f}$ and represent the number of individuals falling in each group (Table 1.6). The sum of all the frequencies, assigned to all classes, represents the total number of individual observations in the given series. In statistics, it is expressed by the symbol N that is equal to $\\sum f$. It is expressed as $\\sum f=N=60$ (Table 1.5 and 1.6).\n\nTable 1.6 : Frequency Distribution\n\n| Group | $f$ | $C f$ |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| $00-10$ | 4 | 4 |\n| $10-20$ | 5 | 9 |\n| $20-30$ | 5 | 14 |\n| $30-40$ | 7 | 21 |\n| $40-50$ | 6 | 27 |\n| $50-60$ | 10 | 37 |\n| $60-70$ | 8 | 45 |\n| $70-80$ | 6 | 51 |\n| $80-90$ | 5 | 56 |\n| $90-100$ | 4 | 60 |\n|  | $\\sum f=N=60$ |  |\n\n# Cumulative Frequencies \n\nIt is expressed by ' $\\boldsymbol{C f}$ ' and can be obtained by adding successive simple frequencies in each group with the previous sum, as shown in the column 3 of Table 1.6. For example, the first simple frequency in Table 1.6 is 4 . Next frequency of 5 is added to 4 which gives a total of 9 as the next cumulative frequency. Likewise, add every next number until the last cumulative frequency of 60 is obtained. Note that it is equal to N or $\\sum f$.\n\nAdvantage of cumulative frequency is that one can easily make out that there are 27 individuals scoring less than 50 or that 45 out of 60 individuals lie below the score of 70 .\n\nEach simple frequency is associated with its group or class. The exclusive or inclusive methods are used for forming the groups or classes.\n\n## Exclusive Method\n\nAs shown in Table 1.6, two numbers are shown in its first column. Notice that the upper limit of one group is the same as the lower limit of the next group. For example, the upper limit of the one group ( $20-30$ ) is 30 , which is the lower limit of the next group ( $30-40$ ), making 30 to appear in both groups. But any observation having the value of 30 is included in the group where it is at its lower limit and it is excluded from the group where it is the upper limit as (in 20-30 groups). That is why the method is known as exclusive method, i.e. a group is excluded of its upper limits. You may now make out where all the marginal values of Table 1.4 will go.\n\nThe groups in Table 1.6, are interpreted in the following manner -\n\n0 and under 10\n20 and under 30\n40 and under 50\n60 and under 70\n80 and under 90\n\n10 and under 20\n30 and under 40\n50 and under 60\n70 and under 80\n90 and under 100\n\nHence, in this type of grouping the class extends over ten units. For example, $20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28$ and 29 are included in the third group.",

      "content": "Inclusive Method\nIn this method, a value equal to the upper limit of a group is included in the same group. Therefore, it is known as inclusive method. Classes are mentioned in a different form in this method, as shown in the first column of Table 1.7. Normally, the upper limit of a group differs by 1 with the lower limits of the next group. It is important to note that each group spreads over ten units in this method also. For example, the group of 50-59 includes the ten values i.e. $50,51,52,53,54$, $55,56,57,58$ and 59 (Table 1.7). In this method, both the upper and lower limit are included to find the frequency distribution.\n\nFrequency Polygon\nA graph of frequency distribution is known as the frequency polygon. It helps in comparing two or more than two frequency distributions (Fig.1.5). The two frequencies are shown using a bar diagram and a line graph respectively.\n\n## Ogive\n\nWhen the frequencies are added they are called cumulative frequencies and are listed in a table called\n\n\n**[IMAGE: A bar chart and ogive representing the number of students and the marks obtained.]**\n\n\n\nFig. 1.5 : Frequency Distribution Polygon\ncumulative frequency table. The curve obtained by plotting cumulative frequencies is called an Ogive (pronounced as ojive). It is constructed either by the less than method or the more than method.\n\nIn the less than method, we start with the upper limit of the classes and go on adding the frequencies. When these frequencies are plotted, we get a rising curve as shown in Table 1.8 and Fig. 1.6.\n\nIn the more than method, we start with the lower limits of the classes and from the cumulative frequency, we substract frequency of each class. When these frequencies are plotted, we get a declining curve as shown in Table 1.9 and Fig 1.7.\n\nBoth the Figs. 1.5 and 1.6 may be combined to get a comparative picture of less than and more than Ogive as shown in Table 1.10 and Fig. 1.7.",

A number of statistical techniques are used to analyse the data e.g.\n\n1. Measures of Central Tendency\n2. Measures of Dispersion\n3. Measures of Relationship\n\nWhile measures of central tendency provide the value that is an ideal representative of a set of observations, the measures of dispersion take into account the internal variations of the data, often around a measure of central tendency. The measures of relationship, on the other hand, provide the degree of association between any two or more related phenomena, like rainfall and incidence of flood or fertiliser consumption and yield of crops. In this chapter, you will learn the measures of central tendency.\n\n# Measures of Central Tendency \n\nThe measurable characteristics such as rainfall, elevation, density of population, levels of educational attainment or age groups vary. If we want to understand them, how would we do? We may, perhaps, require a single value or number that best represents all the observations. This single value usually lies near the centre of a distribution rather than at either extreme. The statistical techniques used to find out the centre of distributions are referred as measures of central tendency. The number denoting the central tendency is the representative figure for the entire data set because it is the point about which items have a tendency to cluster.\n\nMeasures of central tendency are also known as statistical averages. There are a number of the measures of central tendency, such as the mean, median and the mode.\n\n## Mean\n\nThe mean is the value which is derived by summing all the values and dividing it by the number of observations.",

Arranging the data in ascending or descending order and then finding the value of the middle ranking number is the most significant in calculating the median. In case of the even numbers the average of the two middle ranking values will be the median.\n\n## Mode\n\nMode is the maximum occurrence or frequency at a particular point or value. You may notice that each one of these measures is a different method of determining a single representative number suited to different types of the data sets.\n\n## Mean\n\nMean is the simple arithmetic average of the different values of a variable. For ungrouped and grouped data, the methods for calculating mean are necessarily different. Mean can be calculated by direct or indirect methods, for both grouped and ungrouped data.\n\n## Computing Mean from Ungrouped Data\n\n## Direct Method\n\nWhile calculating mean from ungrouped data using the direct method, the values for each observation are added and the total number of occurrences are divided by the sum of all observations. The mean is calculated using the following formula:\n\n$$\n\\bar{X}=\\frac{\\sum x}{N}\n$$\n\nWhere,\n$\\bar{X}=$ Mean\n$\\sum=$ Sum of a series of measures\n$x \\quad=$ A raw score in a series of measures\n$\\sum x=$ The sum of all the measures\nN = Number of measures\n\nExample 2.1 : Calculate the mean rainfall for Malwa Plateau in Madhya Pradesh from the rainfall of the districts of the region given in Table 2.1:\n\nTable 2.1 : Calculation of Mean Rainfall\n\n| Districts in <br> Malwa Plateau | Normal Rainfall <br> in mms | Indirect Method |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: |\n|  | $x$ Direct Method | $d=x \\cdot 800^{*}$ |\n| Indore | 979 | 179 |\n| Dewas | 1083 | 283 |\n| Dhar | 833 | 33 |\n| Ratlam | 896 | 96 |\n| Ujjain | 891 | 91 |\n| Mandsaur | 825 | 25 |\n| Shajapur | 977 | 177 |\n| $\\sum x$ and $\\sum d$ | 6484 | 884 |\n| $\\frac{\\sum x}{\\mathrm{~N}}$ and $\\frac{\\sum d}{\\mathrm{~N}}$ | 926.29 | 126.29 |\n\n* Where 800 is assumed mean.\nd is deviation from the assumed mean.",

Therefore, it is known as direct method.\n\n# Indirect Method \n\nFor a large number of observations, the indirect method is normally used to compute the mean. It helps in reducing the values of the observations to smaller numbers by subtracting a constant value from them. For example, as shown in Table 2.1, the rainfall values lie between 800 and 1100 mm . We can reduce these values by selecting 'assumed mean' and subtracting the chosen number from each value. In the present case, we have taken 800 as assumed mean. Such an operation is known as coding. The mean is then worked out from these reduced numbers (Column 3 of Table 2.1).\n\nThe following formula is used in computing the mean using indirect method:\n\n$$\n\\bar{X}=A+\\frac{\\sum d}{N}\n$$\n\nWhere,\n$A=$ Subtracted constant\n$\\sum d=$ Sum of the coded scores\n$N=$ Number of individual observations in a series\nMean for the data as shown in Table 2.1 can be computed using the indirect method in the following manner:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\bar{X} & =800+\\frac{884}{7} \\\\\n& =800+\\frac{884}{7} \\\\\n\\bar{X} & =926.29 \\mathrm{~mm}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nNote that the mean value comes the same when computed either of the two methods.\n\n## Computing Mean from Grouped Data\n\nThe mean is also computed for the grouped data using either direct or indirect method.\n\n## Direct Method\n\nWhen scores are grouped into a frequency distribution, the individual values lose their identity.

Thus :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\text { Value of }\\left(\\frac{N+1}{2}\\right) \\text { th item } \\\\\n& =\\left(\\frac{7+1}{2}\\right) \\text { th item } \\\\\n& =\\left(\\frac{8}{2}\\right) \\text { th item }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n## 4th item in the arranged series will be the Median.\n\nArrangement of data in ascending order -\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n7,817 ; 8,076 ; 8,126 ; 8,172 ; 8,598 ; 8,611 ; 8,848 \\\\\n4 \\text { th item }\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nHence,\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{M}=8,172 \\mathrm{~m}\n$$\n\n## Computing Median for Grouped Data\n\nWhen the scores are grouped, we have to find the value of the point where an individual or observation is centrally located in the group.

It is symbolised as $\\mathbf{Z}$ or $\\mathbf{M}_{0}$. Mode is a measure that is less widely used compared to mean and median. There can be more than one type mode in a given data set.\n\n## Computing Mode for Ungrouped Data\n\nWhile computing mode from the given data sets all measures are first arranged in ascending or descending order. It helps in identifying the most frequently occurring measure easily.\n\nExample 2.5 : Calculate mode for the following test scores in geography for ten students :\n\n$$\n61,10,88,37,61,72,55,61,46,22\n$$\n\nComputation: To find the mode the measures are arranged in ascending order as given below:\n\n$$\n10,22,37,46,55,61,61,61,72,88\n$$\n\nThe measure 61 occurring three times in the series is the mode in the given dataset. As no other number is in the similar way in the dataset, it possesses the property of being unimodal.\n\nExample 2.6 : Calculate the mode using a different sample of ten other students, who scored:\n\n$$\n82,11,57,82,08,11,82,95,41,11\n$$\n\nComputation : Arrange the given measures in an ascending order as shown below :\n\n$$\n08,11,11,11,41,57,82,82,82,95\n$$\n\nIt can easily be observed that measures of 11 and 82 both are occurring three times in the distribution. The dataset, therefore, is bimodal in appearance. If three values have equal and highest frequency, the series is trimodal. Similarly, a recurrence of many measures in a series makes it multimodal. However, when there is no measure being repeated in a series it is designated as without mode.\n\n## Comparison of Mean, Median and Mode\n\nThe three measures of the central tendency could easily be compared with the help of normal distribution curve. The normal curve refers to a frequency distribution in which the graph of scores often called a bell-shaped curve. Many",

For example, the thematic maps shown in Chapter 1 of book for Class XI entitled Practical Work in Geography, Part-I (NCERT, 2006) depict relief and slope, climatic conditions, distribution of rocks and minerals, soils, population, industries, general land use and cropping pattern in the Nagpur district, Maharashtra. These maps have been drawn using large volume of related data collected, compiled and processed. Have you ever thought what would have happened if the same information would have been either in tabular form or in a descriptive transcript? Perhaps, it would not have been possible from such a medium of communication to draw visual impressions which we get through these maps. Besides, it would also have been a time consuming task to draw inferences about whatever is being presented in non-graphical form. Hence, the graphs, diagrams and maps enhance our capabilities to make meaningful comparisons between the phenomena represented, save our time and present a simplified view of the characteristics represented. In the present chapter, we will discuss methods of constructing different types of graphs, diagrams and maps.\n\n# Representation of Data \n\nThe data describe the properties of the phenomena they represent. They are collected from a variety of sources (Chapter 1). The geographers, economists, resource scientists and the decision makers use a lot of data these days. Besides the tabular form, the data may also be presented in some graphic or diagrammatic form. The transformation of data through visual methods like graphs, diagrams, maps and charts is called representation of data. Such a form of the presentation of data makes it easy to understand the patterns of population growth, distribution and the density, sex ratio, age-sex composition, occupational structure, etc. within a geographical territory. There is a Chinese proverb that ' $a$ picture is equivalent to thousands of words'. Hence, the graphic method of the representation of data enhances our understanding, and makes the comparisons easy. Besides, such methods create an imprint on mind for a longer time.",

      "content": "# General Rules for Drawing Graphs, Diagrams and Maps \n\n## 1. Selection of a Suitable Method\n\nData represent various themes such as temperature, rainfall, growth and distribution of the population, production, distribution and trade of different commodities, etc. These characteristics of the data need to be suitably represented by an appropriate graphical method. For example, data related to the temperature or growth of population between different periods in time and for different countries/states may best be represented using line graphs. Similarly, bar diagrams are suited best for showing rainfall or the production of commodities. The population distribution, both human and livestock, or the distribution of the crop producing areas may suitably be represented on dot maps and the population density using choropleth maps.\n\n## 2. Selection of Suitable Scale\n\nThe scale is used as measure of the data for representation over diagrams and maps. Hence, the selection of suitable scale for the given data sets should be carefully made and must take into consideration entire data that is to be represented. The scale should neither be too large nor too small.\n\n## 3. Design\n\nWe know that the design is an important cartographic task (Refer 'Essentials of Map Making' as discussed in Chapter 1 of the Practical Work in Geography, Part-I (NCERT, 2006), a textbook of Class XI). The following components of the cartographic designs are important. Hence, these should be carefully shown on the final diagram/map.\n\n## Title\n\nThe title of the diagram/map indicates the name of the area, reference year of the data used and the caption of the diagram. These components are represented using letters and numbers of different font sizes and thickness. Besides, their placing also matters. Normally, title, subtitle and the corresponding year are shown in the centre at the top of the map/diagram.\n\n## Legend\n\nA legend or index is an important component of any diagram/map. It explains the colours, shades, symbols and signs used in the map and diagram. It should also be carefully drawn and must correspond to the contents of the map/diagram. Besides, it also needs to be properly positioned. Normally, a legend is shown either at the lower left or lower right side of the map sheet.\n\n## Direction\n\nThe maps, being a representation of the part of the earth's surface, need be oriented to the directions. Hence, the direction symbol, i. e. North, should also be drawn and properly placed on the final map.\n\n## Construction of Diagrams\n\nThe data possess measurable characteristics such as length, width and volume. The diagrams and the maps that are drawn to represent these data related characteristics may be grouped into the following types:",

It would not be possible to discuss the methods of construction of these many types of diagrams and maps primarily due to the time constraint.

These are :\n\n- Line graphs\n- Bar diagrams\n- Pie diagram\n- Wind rose and star diagram\n- Flow Charts\n\n\n# Line Graph \n\nThe line graphs are usually drawn to represent the time series data related to the temperature, rainfall, population growth, birth rates and the death rates. Table 3.1 provides the data used for the construction of Fig 3.2.\n\n## Construction of a Line Graph\n\n(a) Simplify the data by converting it into round numbers, such as the growth rate of population as shown in Table 3.1 for the years 1961 and 1981 may be rounded to 2.0 and 2.2 , respectively.\n(b) Draw X and Y-axis. Mark the time series variables (years/months) on the X axis and the data quantity/value to be plotted (growth of population in per cent or the temperature in ${ }^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ ) on Y axis.\n(c) Choose an appropriate scale and label it on Y-axis. If the data involve a negative figure, then the selected scale should also show it as shown in Fig. 3.1.\n\n\n**[IMAGE: A chart showing population growth over the years from 1901 to 2011.]**\n\n\n\nFig. 3.1 : Construction of a Line Graph\n(d) Plot the data to depict year/month-wise values according to the selected scale on Y-axis, mark the location of the plotted values by a dot and join these dots by a free hand drawn line.",

      "content": "# Flow Maps/Chart \n\nFlow chart is a combination of graph and map. It is drawn to show the flow of commodities or people between the places of origin and destination. It is also called Dynamic Map. Transport map, which shows the number of passengers, vehicles, etc., is the best example of a flow chart. These charts are drawn using lines of proportional width. Many government agencies prepare flow maps to show density of the means of transportation on different routes. The flow maps/ charts are generally drawn to represent two the types of data as given below:\n\n1. The number and frequency of the vehicles as per the direction of their movement\n2. The number of the passengers and/or the quantity of goods transported.\n\n## Requirements for the Preparation of a Flow Map\n\n(a) A route map depicting the desired transport routes along with the connecting stations.\n(b) The data pertaining to the flow of goods, services, number of vehicles, etc., along with the point of origin and destination of the movements.\n(c) The selection of a scale through which the data related to the quantity of passengers and goods or the number of vehicles is to be represented.\n\nExample 3.10 : Construct a flow map to represent the number of trains running in Delhi and the adjoining areas as given in the Table 3.8.\n\nTable 3.8 : No. of trains of selected routes of Delhi and adjoining areas\n\n| S. <br> No. | Railway <br> Routes | No. of <br> Trains |\n| :--: | :-- | :--: |\n| 1. | Old Delhi - New Delhi | 50 |\n| 2. | New Delhi-Nizamuddin | 40 |\n| 3. | Nizamuddin-Badarpur | 30 |\n| 4. | Nizamuddin-Sarojini Nagar | 12 |\n| 5. | Sarojini Nagar - Pusa Road | 8 |\n| 6. | Old Delhi - Sadar Bazar | 32 |\n| 7. | Udyog Nagar-Tikri Kalan | 6 |\n| 8. | Pusa Road - Pehladpur | 15 |\n| 9. | Sahibabad-Mohan Nagar | 18 |\n| 10. | Old Delhi - Silampur | 33 |\n| 11. | Silampur - Nand Nagari | 12 |\n| 12. | Silampur-Mohan Nagar | 21 |\n| 13. | Old Delhi-Shalimar Bagh | 16 |\n| 14. | Sadar Bazar-Udyog Nagar | 18 |\n| 15. | Old Delhi - Pusa Road | 22 |\n| 16. | Pehladpur - Palam Vihar | 12 |\n\n## Construction\n\n(a) Take an outline map of Delhi and adjoining areas, in which railway line and the nodal stations are depicted (Fig.3.9).\n(b) Select a scale to represent the number of trains. Here, the maximum number is 50 and the minimum is 6 . If we select a scale of $1 \\mathrm{~cm}=50$ trains, the maximum and minimum numbers will be represented by a strip of 10 mm and 1.2 mm thick lines, respectively, on the map.\n(c) Plot the thickness of each strip of route between the given rail route (Fig. 3.10).",

For example, physiographic map for population distribution and relief and drainage map for constructing transportation map.\n\n## Rules for Making Thematic Maps\n\n(i) The drawing of the thematic maps must be carefully planned. The final map should properly reflect the following components:\na. Name of the area\nb. Title of the subject-matter\nc. Source of the data and year\nd. Indication of symbols, signs, colours, shades, etc.\ne. Scale\n(ii) The selection of a suitable method to be used for thematic mapping.\n\n## Classification of Thematic Maps based on Method of Construction\n\nThe thematic maps are, generally, classified into quantitative and non-quantitative maps. The quantitative maps are drawn to show the variations within the data. For example, maps depicting areas receiving more than $200 \\mathrm{~cm}, 100$ to 200 cm , 50 to 100 cm and less than 50 cm of rainfall are referred as quantitative maps. These maps are also called statistical maps. The non-quantitative maps, on the other hand, depict the non-measurable characteristics in the distribution ofgiven information, such as a map showing high and low rainfall-receiving areas. These maps are also called qualitative maps. It would not be possible to discuss drawing these different types of thematic maps under the constraint of time. We will, therefore, confine to discuss the methods of the construction of the following types of quantitative maps:\n(a) Dot maps\n(b) Choropleth maps\n(c) Isopleth maps\n\n## Dot Maps\n\nThe dot maps are drawn to show the distribution of phenomena such as population, cattle, types of crops, etc. The dots of same size as per the chosen scale are marked over the given administrative units to highlight the patterns of distributions.\n\n## Requirement\n\n(a) An administrative map of the given area showing state/district/block boundaries.",

For example, number of dots in Maharashtra will be 9,67,52,247/100,000 $=967.52$. It may be rounded to 968 , as the fraction is more than 0.5 .\n(c) Place the dots in each state as per the determined number in all states.\n(d) Consult the physiographic/relief map of India to identify mountainous, desert, and/or snow covered areas and mark lesser number of dots in such areas.\n\n## Choropleth Map\n\nThe choropleth maps are also drawn to depict the data characteristics as they are related to the administrative units. These maps are used to represent the density of population, literacy/growth rates, sex ratio, etc.\n\n## Requirement for drawing Choropleth Map\n\n(a) A map of the area depicting different administrative units.\n(b) Appropriate statistical data according to administrative units.\n\n## Steps to be followed\n\n(a) Arrange the data in ascending or descending order.\n(b) Group the data into 5 categories to represent very high, high, medium, low and very low concentrations.\n(c) The interval between the categories may be identified on the following formulae i.e., Range $/ 5$ and Range $=$ maximum value - minimum value.\n(d) Patterns, shades or colour to be used to depict the chosen categories should be marked in an increasing or decreasing order.\n\nExample 3.13: Construct a Choropleth map to represent the literacy rates in India in 2001 as given in Table 3.10.\n\n## Construction\n\n(a) Arrange the data in ascending order as shown above.\n(b) Identify the range within the data. In the present case, the states recording the lowest and highest literacy rates are Bihar ( $47 \\%$ ) and Kerala ( $90.9 \\%$ ), respectively. Hence, the range would be $91.0-47.0=$ 44.0\n(c) Divide the range by 5 to get categories from very low to very high. (44.0) $5=8.80$. We can convert this value to a round number, i. e., t 9.0\n(d) Determine the number of the categories alongwith the range of each category. Add 9.0 to the lowest value of 47.0 as so on. We will finally get following categories :\n47 - 56 Very low (Bihar, Jharkhand, Arunachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir)\n56 - 65 Low (Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, Meghalaya, Odisha, Assam, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh)",

However, the variations within the data, in many cases, may also be observed on the basis of natural boundaries. For example, variations in the degrees of slope, temperature, occurrence of rainfall, etc. possess characteristics of the continuity in the data. These geographical facts may be represented by drawing the lines of equal values on a map. All such maps are termed as Isopleth Map. The word Isopleth is derived from Iso meaning equal and pleth means lines. Thus, an imaginary line, which joins the places of equal values, is referred as Isopleth. The more frequently drawn isopleths include Isotherm (equal temperature), Isobar (equal pressure), Isohyets (equal rainfall), Isonephs (equal cloudiness), Isohels (equal sunshine), contours (equal heights), Isobaths (equal depths), Isohaline (equal salinity), etc.\n\n## Requirement\n\n(a) Base line map depicting point location of different places.\n(b) Appropriate data of temperature, pressure, rainfall, etc, over a definite period of time.\n(c) Drawing instrument specially French Curve, etc.\n\nRules to be observed\n(a) An equal interval of values be selected.\n(b) Interval of 5,10 , or 20 is supposed to be ideal.\n(c) The value of Isopleth should be written along the line on either side or in the middle by breaking the line.\n\n## Interpolation\n\nInterpolation is used to insert the intermediate values between the observed values of at two stations/locations, such as temperature recorded at Chennai and Hyderabad or the spot heights of two points. Generally, drawing of isopleths joining the places of same value is also termed as interpolation.\n\n## Method of Interpolation\n\nFor interpolation, follow the following steps:\n(a) Firstly, determine the minimum and maximum values given on the map.\n(b) Calculate the range of value i.e. Range $=$ maximum value - minimum value.\n(c) Based on range, determine the interval in a whole number like 5, 10, 15 , etc.\nThe exact point of drawing an Isopleth is determined by using the following formulae.\n\nPoint of Isopleth $=\\frac{\\text { Distance between two points in cm }}{\\text { Difference between the two values of corresponding points }} \\times$ Interval",

The disciplines that deals with the principles and methods of data processing and mapping using a combination of computer hardware and the application software are referred as the Database Management System (DBMS) and the Computer Assisted Cartography, respectively. However, the role of such computer applications is restricted to merely processing of the data and their graphical presentation. In other words, the data so processed or the maps and diagrams so prepared could not be used to evolve a decision support system. As a matter of fact, there are several questions that we normally encounter in our day-to-day life and look for satisfactory solutions. These questions may be: What is where? Why is it there? What will happen if it is shifted to a new location? Who will be benefited by such a reallocation? Who are expected to loose the benefits if reallocation takes place? In order to, understand these and many other questions, we need to capture the necessary data collected from different sources and integrate them using a computer that is supported by geo-processing tools. Herein lays the concept of a Spatial Information System. In the present chapter, we will discuss basic principles of the Spatial Information Technology and its extension to the Spatial Information System, which is more commonly known as Geographical Information System.\n\n# What is Spatial Information Technology? \n\nThe word spatial is derived from space. It refers to the features and the phenomena distributed over a geographically definable space, thus, having physically measurable dimensions. We know that most data that are used today have spatial components (location), such as an address of a municipal facility, or the boundaries of an agricultural holdings, etc. Hence, the Spatial Information Technology relates to the use of the technological inputs in collecting, storing, retrieving, displaying, manipulating, managing and analysing the spatial information. It is an amalgamation of Remote Sensing, GPS, GIS, Digital Cartography and Database Management Systems.",

      "content": "# What is GIS (Geographical Information System)?\n\nThe advance computing systems available since mid 1970's enable the processing of georeferenced information for the purpose of organising spatial and attribute data and their integration; locating specific information in individual files and executing the computations, performing analysis and evolving a decision support system. A system capable of all such functions is called Geographic Information System (GIS). It is defined as A system for capturing, storing, checking, integrating, manipulating, analysing and displaying data, which are spatially referenced to the Earth. This is normally considered to involve a spatially referenced computer database and appropriate applications software. It is an amalgamation of Computer Assisted Cartography and Database Management System and draws conceptual and methodological strength from both spatial and allied sciences such as Computer Science, Statistics, Cartography, Remote Sensing, Database Technology, Geography, Geology, Hydrology, Agriculture, Resource Management, Environmental Science, and Public Administration.\n\n## Forms of Geographical Information\n\nTwo types of the data represent the geographical information. These are spatial and non-spatial data (Box 4.1). The spatial data are characterised by their positional, linear and areal forms of appearances (Fig. 4.1).\n\nBox 4.1 : Spatial and non-spatial data\n\n|  Stock Register of a Cycle shop |  |  | Literate Population in States 1981 |  |   |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Part No. | Quantity | Description | State | \\% Male | \\% Female  |\n|  101435 | 54 | Wheel Spoke | Kerala | 75.3 | 65.7  |\n|  108943 | 68 | Ball Bearing | Maharashtra | 58.8 | 34.8  |\n|  105956 | 25 | Wheel Rim | Gujarat | 54.4 | 32.3  |\n|  123545 | 108 | Tyre | Punjab | 47.2 | 33.7  |\n\nGeographic Database : A database contains attributes and their value or class.

The data record on the right is spatial because one of the attributes, the name of different states, which have a definite locations in a map. This data can be used in GIS. \n\n**[IMAGE: A diagram illustrating different types of map features: point, line, and area.]**\n\n\n\nFig. 4.1 : The Point, a Line and an Area Feature",

On the other hand, the data those describe the spatial data are called as Non-spatial or attribute data. The spatial data are the most important pre-requisite in a spatial or geographical information system. In a GIS core, it could be built in several ways. These are :\n\n- Acquire data in digital form from a data supplier\n- Digitise existing analogue data\n- Carry out one's own surveys of geographic entities.\n\nThe choice of a source of geographical data for a GIS application is, however, largely governed by :\n\n- The application area in itself\n- The available budget, and\n- The type of data structure, i.e., vector/raster.\n\nFor many users, the most common source of spatial data is topographical or thematic maps in hard copy (paper) or soft copy form (digital). All such maps are characterised by :\n\n- A definite scale which provides relationship between the map and the surface it represents,\n- Use of symbols and colours which define attributes of entities mapped, and\n- An agreed coordinate system, which defines the location of entities on the Earth's surface.\n\n\n# Advantages of GIS over Manual Methods \n\nThe maps, irrespective of a graphic medium of communication of geographic information and possessing geometric fidelity, are inherited with the following limitations:\n(i) Map information is processed and presented in a particular way.\n(ii) A map shows a single or more than one predetermined themes.\n(iii) The alteration of the information depicted on the maps require a new map to be drawn.\nContrarily, a GIS possesses inherent advantages of separate data storage and presentation. It also provides options for viewing and presenting the data in several ways. The following advantages of a GIS are worth mentioning:\n\n1. Users can interrogate displayed spatial features and retrieve associated attribute information for analysis.\n2. Maps can be drawn by querying or analysing attribute data.\n3. Spatial operations (polygon overlay or buffering) can be applied on integrated database to generate new sets of information.\n4. Different items of attribute data can be associated with one another through shared location code.",

The first number, X , is the distance between the point and the left side of the paper; Y , the distance between the point and the bottom of the paper; Z , the point's elevation above or below the paper. Joining the measured points forms the vector.\n\n\n**[IMAGE: A diagram illustrating points and their coordinates in a plane.]**\n\n\n\nFig. 4.5 : The Vector Data Model is based around Coordinate Pairs\nA vector data model uses points stored by their real (earth) coordinates.

Data verification and editing\n4. Spatial and attribute data linkages\n5. Spatial analysis\n\n## Spatial Data Input\n\nAs already mentioned, the spatial database into a GIS can be created from a variety sources. These could be summarised into the following two categories :\n\n## (a) Acquiring Digital Data sets from a Data Supplies\n\nThe present day data supplies make the digital data readily available, which range from small-scale maps to the large-scale plans. For many local governments and private organisations, such data form an essential source and keep such groups of users free from overheads of digitising or collecting their own data. Although, using such existing data sets is attractive and time saving, serious attention must be paid to data compatibility when data from different sources/ supplies are combined in one project. The differences in terms of projection, scale, base level and description in attributes may cause problems.\n\nAt a practical level, users must consider the following characteristics of the data to ensure that they are compatible with the application:\n\n- The scale of the data\n- The geo-referencing system used\n- The data collection techniques and sampling strategy used\n- The quality of data collected\n- The data classification and interpolation methods used\n- The size and shape of the individual mapping units\n- The length of the record.\n\nIt must also be noted that where data are used from a number of sources, and particularly where the area of study crosses administrative boundaries, the difficulties in data integration are caused by different geographical referencing systems, data classification and sampling. Hence, the user needs to be aware of these problems, which are particularly prone when compiling inter-province, and inter-district data sets. Once, the compatibility between the data acquired from different suppliers is established, the next stage involves the transfer of data from a medium of transfer to the GIS. The use of DAT tapes, CD ROMS and floppy disks is becoming increasingly common for the purpose. At this stage, the conversion from encoding and structuring system of the source to that of GIS to be used is important.\n(b) Creating digital data sets by manual input\n\nThe manual input of data to a GIS involves four main stages :\n\n- Entering the spatial data.\n- Entering the attribute data.\n- Spatial and attribute data verification and editing.\n- Where necessary, linking the spatial to the attribute data.",

      "content": "The manual data input methods depend on whether the database has a vector topology or grid cell (raster) structure. The most common ways of inputting spatial data in to a GIS are through:\n\n- Digitisation\n- Scanning\n\nWith the entity model, geographical data are in the form of points, lines and/ or polygons (areas)/pixels which are defined using a series of coordinates. These are obtained by referring to the geographical referencing systems of the map or aerial photograph, or by overlaying a graticule or grid onto it. The use of digitisers and the scanners greatly reduce the time and labour involved in writing down coordinates. We shall, briefly, discuss how the spatial data are created in GIS core using a scanner.\n\n# Scanners \n\nScanners are the devices for converting analogue data into digital grid-based images. They are used in spatial data capture to convert a line map to high-resolution raster images which may be used directly or further processed to get vector topology. There are two basic types of scanners :\n\n- Scanners that record data on a step-for-step basis, and\n- Those that can scan whole document in one operation.\n\nThe first type of scanners incorporates a source of illumination on a movable arm (usually light emitting diodes or a stabilised fluorescent lamp) and a digital camera with high-resolution lamp. The camera is usually equipped with special sensors called Charged Coupled Devices (CCDs) arranged in an array. These are semi-conductor devices that translate the photons of light falling on their surface into counts of electrons, which are then recorded as a digital value.\n\nThe movement of either the scanner or the map builds up a digital two-dimensional image of the map. The map to be scanned can be mounted either on a flat bed, or on a rotating drum. With flatbed scanners, the light source is moved systematically up and down over the surface of the document. For large maps, scanners are used which are mounted on a stand and the illumination source and camera array are fixed in a position. The map is moved past by a feeding mechanism. Modern document scanners resemble laser printers in reverse because the scanning surface is manufactured with a given resolution of light sensitive spots that can be directly addressed by the software. There are no moving parts except a movable light source. The resolution is determined by the geometry of the sensor surface and the amount of memory rather than by a mechanical arm.\n\nThe scanned image is always far from perfect even with the best possible scanners, as it contains all the smudges and defects of the original map. The excess data, therefore, in a digital image must be removed to make it usable.\n\n## Entering the Attribute Data\n\nAttribute data define the properties of a spatial entity that need to be handled in the GIS, but which are not spatial. For example, a road may be captured as a set of contiguous pixels or as a line entity and represented in the spatial part of the GIS by a certain colour, symbol or data location. Information describing the type of road may be included in the range of cartographic symbols. The attribute values associated with the road, such as road width, type of surface, estimated number of traffic and specific traffic regulation may also be stored separately",

The errors caused during digitisation may include data omissions, and under/over shoots. The best way to check for errors in the spatial data is to produce a computer plot or print of the data, preferably on translucent sheet, at the same scale as the original. The two maps may then be placed over each other on a light table and compared visually, working systematically from left to right and top to bottom of the map. Missing data and locational errors should be clearly marked on the printout. The errors that may arise during the capturing of spatial and attribute data may be grouped as under :\n\n## Spatial data are incomplete or double\n\nThe incompleteness in the spatial data arises through omissions in the input of points, lines, or polygons/area of manually entered data. In scanned data the omissions are usually in the form of gaps between lines where the raster vector conversion process has failed to join up all parts of a line.\n\n## Spatial data at the wrong scale\n\nThe digitising at the wrong scale produces input spatial data at a wrong scale. In scanned data, the problems usually arise during the geo-referencing process when incorrect values are used.\n\n## Spatial data are distorted\n\nThe spatial data may also be distorted if the base maps used for digitising are not scale correct. The aerial photographs, in particular, are characterised by incorrect scale because of the lens distortions, relief and till displacements. In addition, paper maps and field documents used for scanning or digitising may contain random distortions as a result of having been exposed to rain, sunshine and frequent folding. Hence, transformation from one coordinate system to another may be needed if the coordinate system of the database is different from that used in the input document or image.\n\nThese errors need corrections through various editing and updating functions as supported directly by most GIS software. The process is time-consuming and interactive that can take longer time than the data input itself. The data editing is usually undertaken by viewing the portion of map containing the errors on the computer screen and correcting them through the software using the keyboard screen cursor controlled by a mouse or a small digitiser tablet.\n\nMinor locational errors in a vector database may be corrected by moving the spatial entity through the screen cursor. In some GIS, computer commands may be used directly to move, rotate, erase, insert, stretch or truncate the graphical entities are required. Where excess coordinates define a line these may be removed using 'weeding' algorithms. Attribute values and spatial errors in raster data",

Once, the spatial errors have been corrected, the topology of vector line and polygon networks can be generated.\n\n# Data Conversion \n\nWhile manipulating and analysing data, the same format should be used for all data. When different layers are to be used simultaneously, they should all be in vector or all in raster format. Usually, the conversion is from vector to raster, because the biggest part of the analysis is done in the raster domain. Vector data are transformed to raster data by overlaying a grid with a user-defined cell size.\n\nSometimes, the data in the raster format are converted into vector format. This is the case especially if one wants to achieve data reduction because the data storage needed for raster data are much larger than for vector data.\n\n## Geographic Data : Linkages and Matching\n\nThe linkages of spatial and the attribute data are important in GIS. It must, therefore, carefully be undertaken. Linking of attribute data with a non-related spatial data shall lead to chaos in ultimate data analysis. Similarly, matching of one data layer with another is also significant.\n\n## Linkages\n\nA GIS typically links different data sets. Suppose, we want to know the mortality rate due to malnutrition among children under 10 years of age in any state. If we have one file that contains the number of children in this age group, and another that contains the mortality rate from malnutrition, we must first combine or link the two data files. Once this is done, we can divide one figure by the other to obtain the desired answer.\n\n## Exact Matching\n\nExact matching means when we have information in one computer file about many geographic features (e.g., towns) and additional information in another file about the same set of features. The operation to bring them together may easily be achieved using a key common to both files, i. e. name of the towns. Thus, the record in each file with the same town name is extracted, and the two are joined and stored in another file.\n\n## Hierarchical Matching\n\nSome types of information, however, are collected in more detail and less frequently than other types of information. For example, land use data covering a large area are collected quite frequently. On the other hand, land transformation data are collected in small areas but at less frequent intervals. If the smaller areas adjust within the larger ones, then the way to make the data match of the same area is to use hierarchical matching - add the data for the small areas together until the grouped areas match the bigger ones and then match them exactly.\n\n## Fuzzy Matching\n\nOn many occasions, the boundaries of the smaller areas do not match with those of the larger ones. The problem occurs more often when the environmental data are involved. For example, crop boundaries that are usually defined by field edges/boundaries rarely match with the boundaries of the soil types. If we want",

This is like laying one map over another and noting the combinations of soil and productivity.\n\nA GIS can carry out all these operations. However, the sets of spatial information are linked only when they relate to the same geographical area.\n\n# Spatial Analysis \n\nThe strength of the GIS lies in its analytical capabilities. What distinguish the GIS from other information systems are its spatial analysis functions. The analysis functions use the spatial and non-spatial attributes in the database to answer questions about the real world. Geographic analysis facilitates the study of realworld processes by developing and applying models. Such models provide the underlying trends in geographic data and thus, make new possibilities available. The objective of geographic analysis is to transform data into useful information to satisfy the requirements of the decision-makers. For example, GIS may effectively be used to predict future trends over space and time related to variety of phenomena. However, before undertaking any GIS based analysis, one needs to identify the problem and define purpose of the analysis. It requires step - by step procedures to arrive at the conclusions. The following spatial analysis operation may be undertaken using GIS :\n(i) Overlay analysis\n(ii) Buffer analysis\n(iii) Network analysis\n(iv) Digital Terrain Model\n\nHowever, under the constraints of time and space only the overlay and buffer analysis operations will be dealt herewith.\n\n## Overlay Analysis Operations\n\nThe hallmark of GIS is overlay operations. An integration of multiple layers of maps using overlay operations is an important analysis function. In other words, GIS makes it possible to overlay two or more thematic layers of maps of the same area to obtain a new map layer (Fig. 4.7). The overlay operations of a GIS are\n\n\n**[IMAGE: Diagram explaining the overlay operation of road and rail maps to create a transportation map.]**\n\n\n\nFig. 4.7 : Simple Overlay Operation",

It can be used to study the changes in land use/land cover over two different periods in time and analyse the land transformations. For example, Fig. 4.8 depicts urban land use during 1974 and 2001. When the two maps overlaid, the changes in urban land use have been obtained (Fig. 4.9) and the urban sprawl is mapped during the given time period (Fig. 4.10). Similarly, overlay analysis is also useful in suitability analysis of the given land use for proposed land uses.\n\n\n**[IMAGE: A diagram showing the urban sprawl of Aligarh City from 1974 to 2001.]**\n\n\n\nFig. 4.10 : Urban Sprawl of Aligarh City, Uttar Pradesh during 1974-2001\n\n# Buffer Operation \n\nBuffer operation is another important spatial analysis function in GIS. A buffer of a certain specified distance can be created along any point, line or area feature (Fig. 4.11). It is useful in locating the areas/population benefitted or denied of the facilities and services, such as hospitals, medical stores, post office, asphalt roads, regional parks, etc. Similarly, it can also be used to study the impact of point sources of air, noise or water pollution on human health and the size of the population so affected. This kind of analysis is called proximity analysis. The buffer operation will generate polygon feature types irrespective of geographic features and delineates spatial proximity. For example, numbers of household living within one-kilometre buffer from a chemical industrial unit are affected by industrial waste discharged from the unit.\n\nArc View/ArcGIS, Geomedia Quantum GIS free opensoftware and all other GIS softwares provide modules for buffer analysis along point, line and area features. For example, by using appropriate commands of either of the available software, one can create buffers of $2,4,6,8$ and 10 kilometres around the cities having a major hospital located.

They may be drawn either horizontally or vertically.\n\nCentral Tendency : The tendency of quantitative data to cluster around some value.\nChoropleth Maps : Maps drawn on quantitative areal basis, calculated as average values per unit of area within specific administrative units, e.g. density of population and percentage of urban to total population. Distribution of a given phenomenon is shown by various shades of a colour or intensity.\n\nClass Intervals : The difference between the lower and upper limits of any class of a frequency distribution is known as its class interval.\n\nCorrelation Co-efficient : A measure of the degree and direction of relationship between two variables.\n\nCumulative Frequency : The measurement of distribution of values in the different class intervals expressed as a percentage of the total frequencies either above or below specified value.\n\nDispersion : The degree of internal variations in the different values of a variable.\nFlow Maps : Maps in which the \"flow\" or movement of people or commodities is represented by riband whose thickness is proportional to the quantity of goods or the number of people moving along different routes.\n\nHistogram : A graphical representation of a frequency distribution, such as seasonal frequencies of rainfall.\n\nMean Deviation : A measure of dispersion derives from the average of deviations from some central value. Such deviations are taken absolutely, i.e., their signs are ignored. The central value is generally mean or median.\n\nMedian : It is the value which divides the number of observations in such a way that half the value are less than this value and half of them are more. If the values of a variable are arranged in either ascending of descending order, the median is the middle value.\n\nMode : The mode is that value of a variable which occurs maximum number of times.\nPie Diagram : A circular diagram in which a circle is divided into sectors for presenting data in percentage.\n\nStandard Deviation : The most commonly used measure of dispersion. The standard deviation is the positive square root of the mean of the squares of deviations from the mean.\n\nTabulation : The process of putting raw data into a systematically arranged tabular form.\nVariable : Any characteristic which varies. A quantitative variable is a characteristic which has different values; the differences of which are quantitatively measurable. Rainfall, for example, is a quantitative variables, because the differences in its different values at different places or at different times are quantitatively measurable. A qualitative variable on the other hand, is the characteristic; the different values of which cannot be measured quantitatively. Sex, for example, is a qualitative variable, it can be either male or female. A qualitative variable is also known as an attribute.",
