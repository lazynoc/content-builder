You are\nalready aware of some of the phenomena of\ngeographical nature in the world and its\ndifferent parts. Now, you will study 'Geography'\nas an independent subject and learn about the\nphysical environment of the earth, human\nactivities and their interactive relationships.\nTherefore, a pertinent question you can ask at\nthis stage is — Why should we study\ngeography? We live on the surface of the earth.\nOur lives are affected by our surroundings in\nmany ways. We depend on the resources to\nsustain ourselves in the surrounding areas.\nPrimitive societies subsisted on 'natural means\nof subsistence', i.e. edible plants and animals.\nWith the passage of time, we developed\ntechnologies and started producing our food\nusing natural resources such as land, soil and\nwater. We adjusted our food habits and\nclothing according to the prevailing weather\nconditions. There are variations in the natural\nresource base, technological development,\nadaptation with and modification of physical\nenvironment, social organisations and cultural\ndevelopment. As a student of geography, you\nshould be curious to know about all the\nphenomena which vary over space. You learn\nabout the diverse lands and people. You\nshould also be interested in understanding the\nchanges which have taken place over time.\nGeography equips you to appreciate diversity\nand investigate into the causes responsible for\ncreating such variations over time and space.\nYou will develop skills to understand the globe\nconverted into maps and have a visual sense\nof the earth's surface. The understanding and\nthe skills obtained in modern scientific\ntechniques such as GIS and computer\ncartography equip you to meaningfully\ncontribute to the national endeavour for\ndevelopment.\n\nNow the next question which you may like\nto ask is — What is geography? You know that\nearth is our home. It is also the home of many\nother creatures, big and small, which live on\nthe earth and sustain. The earth's surface is\nnot uniform. It has variations in its physical\nfeatures. There are mountains, hills, valleys,\nplains, plateaus, oceans, lakes, deserts and\nwilderness. There are variations in its social\nand cultural features too. There are villages,\ncities, roads, railways, ports, markets and\nmany other elements created by human beings\nacross the entire period of their cultural\ndevelopment.\n\nThis variation provides a clue to the\nunderstanding of the relationship between the\nphysical environment and social/cultural\nfeatures. The physical environment has\nprovided the stage, on which human societies\nenacted the drama of their creative skills with\nthe tools and techniques which they invented\nand evolved in the process of their cultural\ndevelopment. Now, you should be able to\nattempt the answer of the question posed\nearlier as to \"What is geography\"? In very\nsimple words, it can be said that geography\nis the description of the earth. The term\n*geography* was first coined by *Eratosthenese*,\na Greek scholar (276-194 BC.). The word has\nbeen derived from two roots from Greek\nlanguage *geo* (earth) and *graphos* (description).",

      "content": "Put together, they mean description of the earth. The earth has always been seen as the abode of human beings and thus, scholars defined geography as, \"the description of the earth as the abode of human beings\". You are aware of the fact that reality is always multifaceted and the 'earth' is also multi-dimensional, that is why many disciplines from natural sciences such as geology, pedology, oceanography, botany, zoology and meteorology and a number of sister disciplines in social sciences such as economics, history, sociology, political science, anthropology, etc. study different aspects of the earth's surface. Geography is different from other sciences in its subject matter and methodology but at the same time, it is closely related to other disciplines. Geography derives its data base from all the natural and social sciences and attempts their synthesis.\n\nWe have noted that there exist variations over the surface of the earth in its physical as well as cultural environment. A number of phenomena are similar and many are dissimilar. It was, therefore, logical to perceive geography as the study of areal differentiation. Thus, geography was perceived to study all those phenomena which vary over space. Geographers do not study only the variations in the phenomena over the earth's surface (space) but also study the associations with the other factors which cause these variations. For example, cropping patterns differ from region to region but this variation in cropping pattern, as a phenomenon, is related to variations in soils, climates, demands in the market, capacity of the farmer to invest and technological inputs available to her/him. Thus, the concern of geography is to find out the causal relationship between any two phenomena or between more than one phenomenon.\n\nA geographer explains the phenomena in a frame of cause and effect relationship, as it does not only help in interpretation but also foresees the phenomena in future.\n\nThe geographical phenomena, both the physical and human, are not static but highly dynamic. They change over time as a result of the interactive processes between ever\nchanging earth and untiring and ever-active human beings. Primitive human societies were directly dependent on their immediate environment. Geography, thus, is concerned with the study of Nature and Human interactions as an integrated whole. 'Human' is an integral part of 'nature' and 'nature' has the imprints of 'human'. 'Nature' has influenced different aspects of human life. Its imprints can be noticed on food, clothing, shelter and occupation. Human beings have come to terms with nature through adaptation and modification. As you already know, the present society has passed the stage of primitive societies, which were directly dependent on their immediate physical environment for sustenance. Present societies have modified their natural environment by inventing and using technology and thus, have expanded the horizon of their operation by appropriating and utilising the resources provided by nature. With the gradual development of technology, human beings were able to loosen the shackles of their physical environment. Technology helped in reducing the harshness of labour, increased labour efficiency and provided leisure to human beings to attend to the higher needs of life. It also increased the scale of production and the mobility of labour.\n\nThe interaction between the physical environment and human beings has been very succinctly described by a poet in the following dialogue between 'human' and 'nature' (God). You created the soil, I created the cup, you created night, I created the lamp. You created wilderness, hilly terrains and deserts; I created flower beds and gardens. Human beings have claimed their contribution using natural resources. With the help of technology, human beings moved from the stage of necessity to a stage of freedom. They have put their imprints everywhere and created new possibilities in collaboration with nature. Thus, we now find humanised nature and naturalised human beings and geography studies this interactive relationship. The space got organised with the help of the means of transportation and communication network. The links (routes) and nodes (settlements of all types and hierarchies) integrated the space and",

      "content": "gradually, it got organised. As a social science discipline, geography studies the 'spatial organisation' and 'spatial integration'.\n\nGeography as a discipline is concerned with three sets of questions:\n(i) Some questions are related to the identification of the patterns of natural and cultural features as found over the surface of the earth. These are the questions about what?\n(ii) Some questions are related to the distribution of the natural and human/ cultural features over the surface of the earth. These are the questions about where?\nTaken together, both these questions take care of distributional and locational aspects of the natural and cultural features. These questions provided inventorised information of what features and where located. It was a very popular approach during the colonial period. These two questions did not make geography a scientific discipline till the third question was added.\n(iii) The third question is related to the explanation or the causal relationships between features and the processes and phenomena. This aspect of geography is related to the question, why?\nGeography as a discipline is related to space and takes note of spatial characteristics and attributes. It studies the patterns of distribution, location and concentration of phenomena over space and interprets them providing explanations for these patterns. It takes note of the associations and interrelationships between the phenomena over space and interprets them providing explanations for these patterns. It also takes note of the associations and inter-relationships between the phenomena resulting from the dynamic interaction between human beings and their physical environment.\n\n## Geography as an Integrating Discipline\n\nGeography is a discipline of synthesis. It attempts spatial synthesis, and history attempts temporal synthesis. Its approach is holistic in nature. It recognises the fact that the world is a system of interdependencies.\n\nThe present world is being perceived as a global village. The distances have been reduced by better means of transportation increasing accessibility. The audio-visual media and information technology have enriched the data base. Technology has provided better chances of monitoring natural phenomena as well as the economic and social parameters. Geography as an integrating discipline has interface with numerous natural and social sciences. All the sciences, whether natural or social, have one basic objective, of understanding the reality. Geography attempts to comprehend the associations of phenomena as related in sections of reality. Figure 1.1 shows the relationship of geography with other sciences. Every discipline, concerned with scientific knowledge is linked with geography as many of their elements vary over space. Geography helps in understanding the reality in totality in its spatial perspective. Geography, thus, not only takes note of the differences in the phenomena from place to place but integrates them holistically which may be different at other places. A geographer is required to have a broad understanding of all the related fields, to be able to logically integrate them. This integration can be understood with some examples. Geography influences historical events. Spatial distance itself has been a very potent factor to alter the course of history of the world. Spatial depth provided defence to many countries, particularly in the last century. In traditional warfare, countries with large size in area, gain time at the cost of space. The defence provided by oceanic expanse around the countries of the new world has protected them from wars being imposed on their soil. If we look at the historical events world over, each one of them can be interpreted geographically.\n\nIn India, Himalayas have acted as great barriers and provided protection but the passes provided routes to the migrants and invaders from Central Asia. The sea coast has encouraged contact with people from East and Southeast Asia, Europe and Africa. Navigation technology helped European countries to colonise a number of countries of Asia and Africa, including India as they got accessibility",

      "content": "through oceans. The geographical factors have modified the course of history in different parts of the world.\n\nEvery geographical phenomenon undergoes change through time and can be explained temporally. The changes in landforms, climate, vegetation, economic activities occupations and cultural developments have followed a definite historical course. Many geographical features result from the decision making process by different institutions at a particular point of time. It is possible to convert time in terms of space and space in terms of time. For example, it can be said that place A is $1,500 \\mathrm{~km}$ from place B or alternately, it can also be said that place A is two hours away (if one travels by plane) or seventeen hours away (if one travels by a fast moving train). It is for this reason, time is an integral part of geographical studies as the fourth dimension. Please mention other three dimensions?\n\nFigure1.1 amply depicts the linkages of geography with different natural and social sciences. This linkage can be put under two segments.\n\n## Branches of Geography\n\nPlease study Figure 1.1 for recapitulation. It has very clearly brought out that geography is an interdisciplinary subject of study. The study of every subject is done according to some approach. The major approaches to study geography have been (i) Systematic and (ii) Regional. The systematic geography approach is the same as that of general geography. This approach was introduced by Alexander Von Humboldt, a German geographer (1769-1859) while regional geography approach was developed by another German geographer and a contemporary of Humboldt, Karl Ritter (1779-1859).\n\nIn systematic approach (Figure 1.2), a phenomenon is studied world over as a whole, and then the identification of typologies or spatial patterns is done. For example, if one is interested in studying natural vegetation, the study will be done at the world level as a first step. The typologies such as equatorial rain forests or softwood conical forests or monsoon\nforests, etc. will be identified, discussed and delimited. In the regional approach, the world is divided into regions at different hierarchical levels and then all the geographical phenomena in a particular region are studied. These regions may be natural, political or designated region. The phenomena in a region are studied in a holistic manner searching for unity in diversity.\n\nDualism is one of the main characteristics of geography which got introduced from the very beginning. This dualism depended on the aspect emphasised in the study. Earlier scholars laid emphasis on physical geography. But human beings are an integral part of the earth's surface. They are part and parcel of nature. They also have contributed through their cultural development. Thus developed human geography with emphasis on human activities.\n\n## Branches of Geography (Based on Systematic Approach)\n\n## 1. Physical Geography\n\n(i) Geomorphology is devoted to the study of landforms, their evolution and related processes.\n(ii) Climatology encompasses the study of structure of atmosphere and elements of weather and climates and climatic types and regions.\n(iii) Hydrology studies the realm of water over the surface of the earth including oceans, lakes, rivers and other water bodies and its effect on different life forms including human life and their activities.\n(iv) Soil Geography is devoted to study the processes of soil formation, soil types, their fertility status, distribution and use.\n\n## 2. Human Geography\n\n(i) Social/Cultural Geography encompasses the study of society and its spatial dynamics as well as the cultural elements contributed by the society.",

Thus, the capacity to attempt analysis has increased tremendously. GIS has further opened vistas of knowledge. GPS has become a handy tool to find out exact locations. Technologies have enhanced the capacity of attempting synthesis with sound theoretical understanding.\n\nYou will learn some preliminary aspects of these techniques in your book, Practical work in Geography - Part I (NCERT, 2006). You will continue to improve upon your skills and learn about their application.\n\n## Physical Geography and its Importance\n\nThis chapter appears in the book entitled Fundamentals of Physical Geography. The contents of the book clearly reflect its scope. It is therefore, appropriate to know the importance of this branch of geography. Physical geography includes the study of lithosphere (landforms, drainage, relief and physiography), atmosphere (its composition, structure, elements and controls of weather and climate; temperature, pressure, winds, precipitation, climatic types, etc.), hydrosphere (oceans, seas, lakes and associated features with water realm) and biosphere ( life forms including human being and macro-organism and their sustaining mechanism, viz. food chain, ecological parameters and ecological balance). Soils are formed through the process of pedogenesis and depend upon the parent rocks, climate, biological activity and time. Time provides maturity to soils and helps in the development of soil profiles. Each element is important for human beings. Landforms provide the base on which human activities are located. The plains are utilised for agriculture. Plateaus provide forests and minerals. Mountains provide pastures, forests, tourist spots and are sources of rivers providing water to lowlands. Climate influences our house types, clothing and food habits. The climate has a profound effect on vegetation, cropping\npattern, livestock farming and some industries, etc. Human beings have developed technologies which modify climatic elements in a restricted space such as air conditioners and coolers. Temperature and precipitation ensure the density of forests and quality of grassland. In India, monsoonal rainfall sets the agriculture rhythm in motion. Precipitation recharges the ground water aquifers which later provides water for agriculture and domestic use. We study oceans which are the store house of resources. Besides fish and other sea-food, oceans are rich in mineral resources. India has developed the technology for collecting manganese nodules from oceanic bed. Soils are renewable resources, which influence a number of economic activities such as agriculture. The fertility of the soil is both naturally determined and culturally induced. Soils also provide the basis for the biosphere accommodating plants, animals and micro organisms.\n\n## What is Geography?\n\nGeography is concerned with the description and explanation of the areal differentiation of the earth's surface.\n\nRichard Hartshorne\nGeography studies the differences of phenomena usually related in different parts of the earth's surface.\n\nHettner\n\nThe study of physical geography is emerging as a discipline of evaluating and managing natural resources. In order to achieve this objective, it is essential to understand the intricate relationship between physical environment and human beings. Physical environment provides resources, and human beings utilise these resources and ensure their economic and cultural development. Accelerated pace of resource utilisation with the help of modern technology has created ecological imbalance in the world. Hence, a better understanding of physical environment is absolutely essential for sustainable development.",

You may also have thought of these stars and had numerous questions in your mind. Questions such as how many stars are there in the sky? How did they come into existence? Can one reach the end of the sky? May be many more such questions are still there in your mind. In this chapter, you will learn how these \"twinkling little stars\" were formed. With that you will eventually also read the story of origin and evolution of the earth.\n\n## Early Theories\n\n## Origin of the Earth\n\nA large number of hypotheses were put forth by different philosophers and scientists regarding the origin of the earth. One of the earlier and popular arguments was by German philosopher Immanuel Kant. Mathematician Laplace revised it in 1796. It is known as Nebular Hypothesis. The hypothesis considered that the planets were formed out of a cloud of material associated with a youthful sun, which was slowly rotating. In 1950, Otto Schmidt in Russia and Carl Weizascar in Germany somewhat revised the 'nebular hypothesis', though differing in details. They considered that the sun was surrounded by solar nebula containing mostly the hydrogen and helium along with what may be termed as dust. The friction and collision of particles led to formation of a disk-shaped cloud and the planets were\nformed through the process of accretion.\nHowever, scientists in later period took up the problems of origin of universe rather than that of just the earth or the planets.\n\n## Modern Theories\n\n## Origin of the Universe\n\nThe most popular argument regarding the origin of the universe is the Big Bang Theory. It is also called expanding universe hypothesis. Edwin Hubble, in 1920, provided evidence that the universe is expanding. As time passes, galaxies move further and further apart. You can experiment and find what does the expanding universe mean. Take a balloon and mark some points on it to represent the galaxies. Now, if you start inflating the balloon, the points marked on the balloon will appear to be moving away from each other as the balloon expands. Similarly, the distance between the galaxies is also found to be increasing and thereby, the universe is considered to be expanding. However, you will find that besides the increase in the distances between the points on the balloon, the points themselves are expanding. This is not in accordance with the fact. Scientists believe that though the space between the galaxies is increasing, observations do not support the expansion of galaxies. So, the balloon example is only partially correct.\n\nThe Big Bang Theory considers the following stages in the development of the universe.\n(i) In the beginning, all matter forming the universe existed in one place in the form of a \"tiny ball\" (singular atom) with an",

This led to a huge expansion. It is now generally accepted that the event of big bang took place 13.7 billion years before the present. The expansion continues even to the present day. As it grew, some energy was converted into matter. There was particularly rapid expansion within fractions of a second after the bang. Thereafter, the expansion has slowed down. Within first three minutes from the Big Bang event, the first atom began to form.\n(iii) Within 300,000 years from the Big Bang, temperature dropped to $4,500 \\mathrm{~K}$ (Kelvin) and gave rise to atomic matter. The universe became transparent.\nThe expansion of universe means increase in space between the galaxies. An alternative to this was Hoyle's concept of steady state. It considered the universe to be roughly the same\nat any point of time. However, with greater evidence becoming available about the expanding universe, scientific community at present favours argument of expanding universe.\n\n## The Star Formation\n\nThe distribution of matter and energy was not even in the early universe. These initial density differences gave rise to differences in gravitational forces and it caused the matter to get drawn together. These formed the bases for development of galaxies. A galaxy contains a large number of stars. Galaxies spread over vast distances that are measured in thousands of light-years. The diameters of individual galaxies range from 80,000-150,000 light years. A galaxy starts to form by accumulation of hydrogen gas in the form of a very large cloud called nebula. Eventually, growing nebula develops localised clumps of gas. These clumps continue to grow into even denser gaseous bodies, giving rise to formation of stars. The formation of stars is believed to have taken place some 5-6 billion years ago.\n\nA light year is a measure of distance and not of time. Light travels at a speed of $300,000 \\mathrm{~km} /$ second. Considering this, the distances the light will travel in one year is taken to be one light year. This equals to $9.46110^{12} \\mathrm{~km}$. The mean distance between the sun and the earth is $149,598,000 \\mathrm{~km}$. In terms of light years, it is 8.311 minutes.\n\n## Formation of Planets\n\nThe following are considered to be the stages in the development of planets :\n(i) The stars are localised lumps of gas within a nebula. The gravitational force within the lumps leads to the formation of a core to the gas cloud and a huge rotating disc of gas and dust develops around the gas core.",

      "content": "(ii) In the next stage, the gas cloud starts getting condensed and the matter around the core develops into smallrounded objects. These small-rounded objects by the process of cohesion develop into what is called planetesimals. Larger bodies start forming by collision, and gravitational attraction causes the material to stick together. Planetesimals are a large number of smaller bodies.\n(iii) In the final stage, these large number of small planetesimals accrete to form a fewer large bodies in the form of planets.\n\n## Evolution of the Earth\n\nDo you know that the planet earth initially was a barren, rocky and hot object with a thin atmosphere of hydrogen and helium. This is far from the present day picture of the earth. Hence, there must have been some eventsprocesses, which may have caused this change from rocky, barren and hot earth to a beautiful planet with ample amount of water and conducive atmosphere favouring the existence of life. In the following section, you will find out how the period, between the 4,600 million years and the present, led to the evolution of life on the surface of the planet.\n\nThe earth has a layered structure. From the outermost end of the atmosphere to the centre of the earth, the material that exists is not uniform. The atmospheric matter has the least density. From the surface to deeper depths, the earth's interior has different zones and each of these contains materials with different characteristics.\n\nHow was the layered structure of the earth developed?\n\n## Evolution of Lithosphere\n\nThe earth was mostly in a volatile state during its primordial stage. Due to gradual increase in density the temperature inside has increased. As a result the material inside started getting separated depending on their densities. This allowed heavier materials (like\niron) to sink towards the centre of the earth and the lighter ones to move towards the surface. With passage of time it cooled further and solidified and condensed into a smaller size. This later led to the development of the outer surface in the form of a crust. During the formation of the moon, due to the giant impact, the earth was further heated up. It is through the process of differentiation that the earth forming material got separated into different layers. Starting from the surface to the central parts, we have layers like the crust, mantle, outer core and inner core. From the crust to the core, the density of the material increases. We shall discuss in detail the properties of each of this layer in the next chapter.\n\n## Evolution of Atmosphere and Hydrosphere\n\nThe present composition of earth's atmosphere is chiefly contributed by nitrogen and oxygen. You will be dealing with the composition and structure of the earth's atmosphere in Chapter 8.\n\nThere are three stages in the evolution of the present atmosphere. The first stage is marked by the loss of primordial atmosphere. In the second stage, the hot interior of the earth contributed to the evolution of the atmosphere. Finally, the composition of the atmosphere was modified by the living world through the process of photosynthesis.\n\nThe early atmosphere, with hydrogen and helium, is supposed to have been stripped off as a result of the solar winds. This happened not only in case of the earth, but also in all the terrestrial planets, which were supposed to have lost their primordial atmosphere through the impact of solar winds.\n\nDuring the cooling of the earth, gases and water vapour were released from the interior solid earth. This started the evolution of the present atmosphere. The early atmosphere largely contained water vapour, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, methane, ammonia and very little of free oxygen. The process through which the gases were outpoured from the interior is called degassing. Continuous volcanic eruptions contributed water vapour and gases",

      "content": "to the atmosphere. As the earth cooled, the water vapour released started getting condensed. The carbon dioxide in the atmosphere got dissolved in rainwater and the temperature further decreased causing more condensation and more rains. The rainwater falling onto the surface got collected in the depressions to give rise to oceans. The earth's oceans were formed within 500 million years from the formation of the earth. This tells us that the oceans are as old as 4,000 million years. Sometime around 3,800 million years ago, life began to evolve. However, around 2,500-3,000 million years before the present, the process of photosynthesis got evolved. Life was confined to the oceans for a long time. Oceans began to have the contribution of oxygen through the process of photosynthesis. Eventually, oceans were saturated with oxygen, and\n\n2,000 million years ago, oxygen began to flood the atmosphere.\n\n## Origin of Life\n\nThe last phase in the evolution of the earth relates to the origin and evolution of life. It is undoubtedly clear that initially the earth or even the atmosphere of the earth was not conducive for the development of life. Modern scientists refer to the origin of life as a kind of chemical reaction, which first generated complex organic molecules and assembled them. This assemblage was such that they could duplicate themselves converting inanimate matter into living substance. The record of life that existed on this planet in different periods is found in rocks in the form of fossils. The microscopic structures closely related to the present form of blue algae have been found in geological formations much older than some 3,000 million years. It can be assumed that life began to evolve sometime 3,800 million years ago.\n\n# EXERCISES \n\n1.

Do you imagine it to be a solid ball like cricket ball or a hollow ball with a thick cover of rocks i.e. lithosphere? Have you ever seen photographs or images of a volcanic eruption on the television screen? Can you recollect the emergence of hot molten lava, dust, smoke, fire and magma flowing out of the volcanic crater? The interior of the earth can be understood only by indirect evidences as neither any one has nor any one can reach the interior of the earth.\n\nThe configuration of the surface of the earth is largely a product of the processes operating in the interior of the earth. Exogenic as well as endogenic processes are constantly shaping the landscape. A proper understanding of the physiographic character of a region remains incomplete if the effects of endogenic processes are ignored. Human life is largely influenced by the physiography of the region. Therefore, it is necessary that one gets acquainted with the forces that influence landscape development. To understand why the earth shakes or how a tsunami wave is generated, it is necessary that we know certain details of the interior of the earth. In the previous chapter, you have noted that the earth-forming materials have been distributed in the form of layers from the crust to the core. It is interesting to know how scientists have gathered information about these layers and what are the characteristics of each of these layers. This is exactly what this chapter deals with.\n\n## Sources of Information about the Interior\n\nThe earth's radius is about $6,378 \\mathrm{~km}$. No one can reach the centre of the earth and make observations or collect samples of the material. Under such conditions, you may wonder how scientists tell us about the earth's interior and the type of materials that exist at such depths. Most of our knowledge about the interior of the earth is largely based on estimates and inferences. Yet, a part of the information is obtained through direct observations and analysis of materials.\n\n## Direct Sources\n\nThe most easily available solid earth material is surface rock or the rocks we get from mining areas. Gold mines in South Africa are as deep as $3-4 \\mathrm{~km}$. Going beyond this depth is not possible as it is very hot at this depth. Besides mining, scientists have taken up a number of projects to penetrate deeper depths to explore the conditions in the crustal portions. Scientists world over are working on two major projects such as \"Deep Ocean Drilling Project\" and \"Integrated Ocean Drilling Project\". The deepest drill at Kola, in Arctic Ocean, has so far reached a depth of 12 km . This and many deep drilling projects have provided large volume of information through the analysis of materials collected at different depths.\n\nVolcanic eruption forms another source of obtaining direct information. As and when the molten material (magma) is thrown onto the surface of the earth, during volcanic eruption it becomes available for laboratory analysis. However, it is difficult to ascertain the depth of the source of such magma.",

      "content": "## Indirect Sources\n\nAnalysis of properties of matter indirectly provides information about the interior. We know through the mining activity that temperature and pressure increase with the increasing distance from the surface towards the interior in deeper depths. Moreover, it is also known that the density of the material also increases with depth. It is possible to find the rate of change of these characteristics. Knowing the total thickness of the earth, scientists have estimated the values of temperature, pressure and the density of materials at different depths. The details of these characteristics with reference to each layer of the interior are discussed later in this chapter.\n\nAnother source of information are the meteors that at times reach the earth. However, it may be noted that the material that becomes available for analysis from meteors, is not from the interior of the earth. The material and the structure observed in the meteors are similar to that of the earth. They are solid bodies developed out of materials same as, or similar to, our planet. Hence, this becomes yet another source of information about the interior of the earth.\n\nThe other indirect sources include gravitation, magnetic field, and seismic activity. The gravitation force $(g)$ is not the same at different latitudes on the surface. It is greater near the poles and less at the equator. This is because of the distance from the centre at the equator being greater than that at the poles. The gravity values also differ according to the mass of material. The uneven distribution of mass of material within the earth influences this value. The reading of the gravity at different places is influenced by many other factors. These readings differ from the expected values. Such a difference is called gravity anomaly. Gravity anomalies give us information about the distribution of mass of the material in the crust of the earth. Magnetic surveys also provide information about the distribution of magnetic materials in the crustal portion, and thus, provide information about the distribution of materials in this part. Seismic activity is one of the most important sources of\ninformation about the interior of the earth. Hence, we shall discuss it in some detail.\n\n## Earthquake\n\nThe study of seismic waves provides a complete picture of the layered interior. An earthquake in simple words is shaking of the earth. It is a natural event. It is caused due to release of energy, which generates waves that travel in all directions.\n\n## Why does the earth shake?\n\nThe release of energy occurs along a fault. A fault is a sharp break in the crustal rocks. Rocks along a fault tend to move in opposite directions. As the overlying rock strata press them, the friction locks them together. However, their tendency to move apart at some point of time overcomes the friction. As a result, the blocks get deformed and eventually, they slide past one another abruptly. This causes a release of energy, and the energy waves travel in all directions. The point where the energy is released is called the focus of an earthquake, alternatively, it is called the hypocentre. The energy waves travelling in different directions reach the surface. The point on the surface, nearest to the focus, is called epicentre. It is the first one to experience the waves. It is a point directly above the focus.\n\n## Earthquake Waves\n\nAll natural earthquakes take place in the lithosphere. You will learn about different layers of the earth later in this chapter. It is sufficient to note here that the lithosphere refers to the portion of depth up to 200 km from the surface of the earth. An instrument called 'seismograph' records the waves reaching the surface. A curve of earthquake waves recorded on the seismograph is given in Figure 3.1. Note that the curve shows three distinct sections each representing different types of wave patterns. Earthquake waves are basically of two types - body waves and surface waves. Body waves are generated due to the release of energy at the focus and move in all directions travelling through the body of the earth. Hence, the name",

      "content": "body waves. The body waves interact with the surface rocks and generate new set of waves called surface waves. These waves move along the surface. The velocity of waves changes as they travel through materials with different densities. The denser the material, the higher is the velocity. Their direction also changes as they reflect or refract when coming across materials with different densities.\n\n\n**[IMAGE: A graph showing the arrival times and amplitudes of P-waves, S-waves, and Surface waves during an earthquake.]**\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1 : Earthquake Waves\nThere are two types of body waves. They are called P and S-waves. P-waves move faster and are the first to arrive at the surface. These are also called 'primary waves'. The P-waves are similar to sound waves. They travel through gaseous, liquid and solid materials. S-waves arrive at the surface with some time lag. These are called secondary waves. An important fact about S-waves is that they can travel only through solid materials. This characteristic of the S-waves is quite important. It has helped scientists to understand the structure of the interior of the earth. Reflection causes waves to rebound whereas refraction makes waves move in different directions. The variations in the direction of waves are inferred with the help of their record on seismograph. The surface waves are the last to report on seismograph. These waves are more destructive. They cause displacement of rocks, and hence, the collapse of structures occurs.\n\n## Propagation of Earthquake Waves\n\nDifferent types of earthquake waves travel in different manners. As they move or propagate, they cause vibration in the body of the rocks through which they pass. P-waves vibrate parallel to the direction of the wave. This exerts\npressure on the material in the direction of the propagation. As a result, it creates density differences in the material leading to stretching and squeezing of the material. Other three waves vibrate perpendicular to the direction of propagation. The direction of vibrations of S-waves is perpendicular to the wave direction in the vertical plane. Hence, they create troughs and crests in the material through which they pass. Surface waves are considered to be the most damaging waves.\n\n## Emergence of Shadow Zone\n\nEarthquake waves get recorded in seismographs located at far off locations. However, there exist some specific areas where the waves are not reported. Such a zone is called the 'shadow zone'. The study of different events reveals that for each earthquake, there exists an altogether different shadow zone. Figure 3.2 (a) and (b) show the shadow zones of P and S-waves. It was observed that seismographs located at any distance within 105 from the epicentre, recorded the arrival of both P and S-waves. However, the seismographs located beyond 145 from epicentre, record the arrival of P-waves, but not that of S-waves. Thus, a zone between 105 and 145 from epicentre was identified as the shadow zone for both the types of waves. The entire zone beyond 105 does not receive S-waves. The shadow zone of S-wave is much larger than that of the P-waves. The shadow zone of P-waves appears as a band around the earth between 105 and 145 away from the epicentre. The shadow zone of S-waves is not only larger in extent but it is also a little over 40 per cent of the earth surface. You can draw the shadow zone for any earthquake provided you know the location of the epicentre.\n\n## Types of Earthquakes\n\n(i) The most common ones are the tectonic earthquakes. These are generated due to sliding of rocks along a fault plane.\n(ii) A special class of tectonic earthquake is sometimes recognised as volcanic earthquake. However, these are confined to areas of active volcanoes.",

These are called collapse earthquakes.\n(iv) Ground shaking may also occur due to the explosion of chemical or nuclear devices. Such tremors are called explosion earthquakes.\n(v) The earthquakes that occur in the areas of large reservoirs are referred to as reservoir induced earthquakes.\n\n## Measuring Earthquakes\n\nThe earthquake events are scaled either according to the magnitude or intensity of the shock. The magnitude scale is known as the Richter scale. The magnitude relates to the energy released during the quake. The magnitude is expressed in numbers, 0-10. The intensity scale is named after Mercalli, an Italian seismologist. The intensity scale takes into account the visible damage caused by the event. The range of intensity scale is from 1-12.\n\n## Effects of Earthquake\n\nEarthquake is a natural hazard.

The mean thickness of oceanic crust is 5 km whereas that of the continental is around 30 km . The continental crust is thicker in the areas of major mountain systems. It is as much as 70 km thick in the Himalayan region.\n\n## The Mantle\n\nThe portion of the interior beyond the crust is called the mantle. The mantle extends from Moho's discontinuity to a depth of $2,900 \\mathrm{~km}$. The upper portion of the mantle is called asthenosphere. The word astheno means weak. It is considered to be extending upto 400 km . It is the main source of magma that finds",

The crust and the uppermost part of the mantle are called lithosphere. Its thickness ranges from 10-200 km. The lower mantle extends beyond the asthenosphere. It is in solid state.\n\n## The Core\n\nAs indicated earlier, the earthquake wave velocities helped in understanding the existence of the core of the earth. The coremantle boundary is located at the depth of $2,900 \\mathrm{~km}$. The outer core is in liquid state while the inner core is in solid state. The core is made up of very heavy material mostly constituted by nickel and iron. It is sometimes referred to as the nife layer.\n\n## Volcanoes and Volcanic Landforms\n\nYou may have seen photographs or pictures of volcanoes on a number of occasions. A volcano is a place where gases, ashes and/or molten rock material - lava - escape to the ground. A volcano is called an active volcano if the materials mentioned are being released or have been released out in the recent past. The layer below the solid crust is mantle. It has\nhigher density than that of the crust. The mantle contains a weaker zone called asthenosphere. It is from this that the molten rock materials find their way to the surface. The material in the upper mantle portion is called magma. Once it starts moving towards the crust or it reaches the surface, it is referred to as laxa. The material that reaches the ground includes lava flows, pyroclastic debris, volcanic bombs, ash and dust and gases such as nitrogen compounds, sulphur compounds and minor amounts of chlorene, hydrogen and argon.\n\n## Volcanoes\n\nVolcanoes are classified on the basis of nature of eruption and the form developed at the surface. Major types of volcanoes are as follows:\n\n## Shield Volcanoes\n\nBarring the basalt flows, the shield volcanoes are the largest of all the volcanoes on the earth. The Hawaiian volcanoes are the most famous\n\n\n**[IMAGE: Aerial view of volcanic craters and lava fields.]**\n\n\n\nShield Volcano\n\n\n**[IMAGE: A photograph of a mountain landscape.]**\n\n\n\nCinder Cone",

      "content": "examples. These volcanoes are mostly made up of basalt, a type of lava that is very fluid when erupted. For this reason, these volcanoes are not steep. They become explosive if somehow water gets into the vent; otherwise, they are characterised by low-explosivity. The upcoming lava moves in the form of a fountain and throws out the cone at the top of the vent and develops into cinder cone.\n\n## Composite Volcanoes\n\nThese volcanoes are characterised by eruptions of cooler and more viscous lavas than basalt. These volcanoes often result in explosive eruptions. Along with lava, large quantities of pyroclastic material and ashes find their way to the ground. This material accumulates in the vicinity of the vent openings leading to formation of layers, and this makes the mounts appear as composite volcanoes.\n\n\n**[IMAGE: A photograph of a snow-capped mountain.]**\n\n\n\n## Caldera\n\nThese are the most explosive of the earth's volcanoes. They are usually so explosive that when they erupt they tend to collapse on themselves rather than building any tall structure. The collapsed depressions are called calderas. Their explosiveness indicates that the magma chamber supplying the lava is not only huge but is also in close vicinity.\n\n## Flood Basalt Provinces\n\nThese volcanoes outpour highly fluid lava that flows for long distances. Some parts of the world are covered by thousands of sq. km of thick basalt lava flows. There can be a series of flows with some flows attaining thickness of\nmore than 50 m . Individual flows may extend for hundreds of km . The Deccan Traps from India, presently covering most of the Maharashtra plateau, are a much larger flood basalt province. It is believed that initially the trap formations covered a much larger area than the present.\n\n## Mid-Ocean Ridge Volcanoes\n\nThese volcanoes occur in the oceanic areas. There is a system of mid-ocean ridges more than $70,000 \\mathrm{~km}$ long that stretches through all the ocean basins. The central portion of this ridge experiences frequent eruptions. We shall be discussing this in detail in the next chapter.\n\n## Volcanic Landforms\n\n## Intrusive Forms\n\nThe lava that is released during volcanic eruptions on cooling develops into igneous rocks. The cooling may take place either on reaching the surface or also while the lava is still in the crustal portion. Depending on the location of the cooling of the lava, igneous rocks are classified as volcanic rocks (cooling at the surface) and plutonic rocks (cooling in the crust). The lava that cools within the crustal portions assumes different forms. These forms are called intrusive forms. Some of the forms are shown in Figure 3.4.\n\n\n**[IMAGE: A diagram illustrating various volcanic landforms and structures.]**\n\n\n\nFigure 3.4 : Volcanic Landforms",

They appear on the surface only after the denudational processes remove the overlying materials. They cover large areas, and at times, assume depth that may be several km . These are granitic bodies. Batholiths are the cooled portion of magma chambers.\n\n## Lacoliths\n\nThese are large dome-shaped intrusive bodies with a level base and connected by a pipe-like conduit from below. It resembles the surface volcanic domes of composite volcano, only these are located at deeper depths. It can be regarded as the localised source of lava that finds its way to the surface. The Karnataka plateau is spotted with domal hills of granite rocks. Most of these, now exfoliated, are examples of lacoliths or batholiths.\n\n## Lapolith, Phacolith and Sills\n\nAs and when the lava moves upwards, a portion of the same may tend to move in a horizontal direction wherever it finds a weak plane. It may get rested in different forms. In\ncase it develops into a saucer shape, concave to the sky body, it is called lapolith. A wavy mass of intrusive rocks, at times, is found at the base of synclines or at the top of anticline in folded igneous country. Such wavy materials have a definite conduit to source beneath in the form of magma chambers (subsequently developed as batholiths). These are called the phacoliths.\n\nThe near horizontal bodies of the intrusive igneous rocks are called sill or sheet, depending on the thickness of the material. The thinner ones are called sheets while the thick horizontal deposits are called sills.\n\n## Dykes\n\nWhen the lava makes its way through cracks and the fissures developed in the land, it solidifies almost perpendicular to the ground. It gets cooled in the same position to develop a wall-like structure. Such structures are called dykes. These are the most commonly found intrusive forms in the western Maharashtra area. These are considered the feeders for the eruptions that led to the development of the Deccan traps.\n\n# EXERCISES \n\n1.

You are already familiar with the world map. You know that continents cover 29 per cent of the surface of the earth and the remainder is under oceanic waters. The positions of the continents and the ocean bodies, as we see them in the map, have not been the same in the past. Moreover, it is now a well-accepted fact that oceans and continents will not continue to enjoy their present positions in times to come. If this is so, the question arises what were their positions in the past? Why and how do they change their positions? Even if it is true that the continents and oceans have changed and are changing their positions, you may wonder as to how scientists know this. How have they determined their earlier positions? You will find the answers to some of these and related questions in this chapter.\n\n## Continental Drift\n\nObserve the shape of the coastline of the Atlantic Ocean. You will be surprised by the symmetry of the coastlines on either side of the ocean. No wonder, many scientists thought of this similarity and considered the possibility of the two Americas, Europe and Africa, to be once joined together. From the known records of the history of science, it was Abraham Ortelius, a Dutch map maker, who first proposed such a possibility as early as 1596. Antonio Pellegrini drew a map showing the three continents together. However, it was Alfred Wegener-a German meteorologist who put forth a comprehensive argument in the form of \"the continental drift\ntheory\" in 1912. This was regarding the distribution of the oceans and the continents.\n\nAccording to Wegener, all the continents formed a single continental mass and mega ocean surrounded the same. The super continent was named PANGAEA, which meant all earth. The mega-ocean was called PANTHALASSA, meaning all water. He argued that, around 200 million years ago, the super continent, Pangaea, began to split. Pangaea first broke into two large continental masses as Laurasia and Gondwanaland forming the northern and southern components respectively. Subsequently, Laurasia and Gondwanaland continued to break into various smaller continents that exist today. A variety of evidence was offered in support of the continental drift. Some of these are given below.\n\n## Evidence in Support of the Continental Drift\n\n## The Matching of Continents (Jig-Saw-Fit)\n\nThe shorelines of Africa and South America facing each other have a remarkable and unmistakable match. It may be noted that a map produced using a computer programme to find the best fit of the Atlantic margin was presented by Bullard in 1964. It proved to be quite perfect. The match was tried at 1,000fathom line instead of the present shoreline.\n\nRocks of Same Age Across the Oceans\nThe radiometric dating methods developed in the recent period have facilitated correlating the rock formation from different continents across",

      "content": "the vast ocean. The belt of ancient rocks of 2,000 million years from Brazil coast matches with those from western Africa. The earliest marine deposits along the coastline of South America and Africa are of the Jurassic age. This suggests that the ocean did not exist prior to that time.\n\n## Tillite\n\nIt is the sedimentary rock formed out of deposits of glaciers. The Gondawana system of sediments from India is known to have its counterparts in six different landmasses of the Southern Hemisphere. At the base, the system has thick tillite indicating extensive and prolonged glaciation. Counterparts of this succession are found in Africa, Falkland Island, Madagascar, Antarctica and Australia. Overall resemblance of the Gondawana-type sediments clearly demonstrates that these landmasses had remarkably similar histories. The glacial tillite provides unambiguous evidence of palaeoclimates and also of drifting of continents.\n\n## Placer Deposits\n\nThe occurrence of rich placer deposits of gold in the Ghana coast and the absolute absence of source rock in the region is an amazing fact. The gold bearing veins are in Brazil and it is obvious that the gold deposits of the Ghana are derived from the Brazil plateau when the two continents lay side by side.\n\n## Distribution of Fossils\n\nWhen identical species of plants and animals adapted to living on land or in fresh water are found on either side of the marine barriers, a problem arises regarding accounting for such distribution. The observations that Lemurs occur in India, Madagascar and Africa led some to consider a contiguous landmass 'Lemuria' linking these three landmasses. Mesosaurus was a small reptile adapted to shallow brackish water. The skeletons of these are found only in two localities: the Southern Cape province of South Africa and Iraver formations of Brazil. The two localities are presently $4,800 \\mathrm{~km}$ apart with an ocean in between them.\n\n## Force for Drifting\n\nWegener suggested that the movement responsible for the drifting of the continents was caused by pole-fleeing force and tidal force. The polar-fleeing force relates to the rotation of the earth. You are aware of the fact that the earth is not a perfect sphere; it has a bulge at the equator. This bulge is due to the rotation of the earth. The second force that was suggested by Wegener - the tidal force - is due to the attraction of the moon and the sun that develops tides in oceanic waters. Wegener believed that these forces would become effective when applied over many million years. However, most of scholars considered these forces to be totally inadequate.\n\n## Post-drift Studies\n\nIt is interesting to note that for continental drift, most of the evidence was collected from the continental areas in the form of distribution of flora and fauna or deposits, like tillite. A number of discoveries during the post-World War II period added new information to geological literature. Particularly, the information collected from the ocean floor mapping provided new dimensions for the study of distribution of oceans and continents.\n\n## Convectional Current Theory\n\nArthur Holmes in 1930s discussed the possibility of convection currents operating in the mantle portion. These currents are generated due to radioactive elements causing thermal differences in the mantle portion. Holmes argued that there exists a system of such currents in the entire mantle portion. This was an attempt to provide an explanation to the issue of force, on the basis of which contemporary scientists discarded the continental drift theory.\n\n## Mapping of the Ocean Floor\n\nDetailed research of the ocean configuration revealed that the ocean floor is not just a vast plain but it is full of relief. Expeditions to map the oceanic floor in the post-World War II period provided a detailed picture of the ocean relief and indicated the existence of submerged",

The dating of the rocks from the oceanic crust revealed the fact that they are much younger than the continental areas. Rocks on either side of the crest of oceanic ridges and having equi-distant locations from the crest were found to have remarkable similarities both in terms of their constituents and their age.\n\n## Ocean Floor Configuration\n\nIn this section we shall note a few things related to the ocean floor configuration that help us in the understanding of the distribution of continents and oceans. You will be studying the details of ocean floor relief in Chapter 12. The ocean floor may be segmented into three major divisions based on the depth as well as the forms of relief. These divisions are continental margins, deep-sea basins and mid-ocean ridges.\n\n\n**[IMAGE: A graph depicting the distribution of Earth's surface features, including the highest mountain, average height, continental shelf, continental slope, average depth, ocean basin floor, and the deepest ocean.]**\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1 : Ocean Floor\n\n## Continental Margins\n\nThese form the transition between continental shores and deep-sea basins. They include continental shelf, continental slope, continental rise and deep-oceanic trenches. Of these, the deep-oceanic trenches are the areas which are of considerable interest in so far as the distribution of oceans and continents is concerned.\n\n## Abyssal Plains\n\nThese are extensive plains that lie between the continental margins and mid-oceanic ridges. The abyssal plains are the areas where the continental sediments that move beyond the margins get deposited.\n\n## Mid-Oceanic Ridges\n\nThis forms an interconnected chain of mountain system within the ocean. It is the longest mountain-chain on the surface of the earth though submerged under the oceanic waters. It is characterised by a central rift system at the crest, a fractionated plateau and flank zone all along its length. The rift system at the crest is the zone of intense volcanic activity. In the previous chapter, you have been introduced to this type of volcanoes as midoceanic volcanoes.\n\n## Distribution of Earthquakes and Volcanoes\n\nStudy the maps showing the distribution of seismic activity and volcanoes given in Figure 4.2. You will notice a line of dots in the central parts of the Atlantic Ocean almost parallel to the coastlines. It further extends into the Indian Ocean. It bifurcates a little south of the Indian subcontinent with one branch moving into East Africa and the other meeting a similar line from Myanmar to New Guiana. You will notice that this line of dots coincides with the midoceanic ridges. The shaded belt showing another area of concentration coincides with the Alpine-Himalayan system and the rim of the Pacific Ocean. In general, the foci of the earthquake in the areas of mid-oceanic ridges are at shallow depths whereas along the Alpine-Himalayan belt as well as the rim of the Pacific, the earthquakes are deep-seated ones. The map of volcanoes also shows a similar pattern. The rim of the Pacific is also called rim of fire due to the existence of active volcanoes in this area.\n\n## Concept of Sea Floor Spreading\n\nAs mentioned above, the post-drift studies provided considerable information that was not",

Particularly, the mapping of the ocean floor and palaeomagnetic studies of rocks from oceanic regions revealed the following facts :\n(i) It was realised that all along the midoceanic ridges, volcanic eruptions are common and they bring huge amounts of lava to the surface in this area.\n(ii) The rocks equidistant on either sides of the crest of mid-oceanic ridges show remarkable similarities in terms of period of formation, chemical compositions and magnetic properties. Rocks closer to the mid-oceanic ridges have normal polarity and are the youngest. The age of the rocks increases as one moves away from the crest.\n(iii) The ocean crust rocks are much younger than the continental rocks. The age of rocks in the oceanic crust is nowhere more than 200 million years old. Some of the continental rock formations are as old as 3,200 million years.\n(iv) The sediments on the ocean floor are unexpectedly very thin. Scientists were expecting, if the ocean floors were as old as the continent, to have a complete sequence of sediments for a period of much longer duration. However, nowhere was the sediment column found to be older than 200 million years.\n(v) The deep trenches have deep-seated earthquake occurrences while in the midoceanic ridge areas, the quake foci have shallow depths.\nThese facts and a detailed analysis of magnetic properties of the rocks on either sides of the mid-oceanic ridge led Hess (1961) to propose his hypothesis, known as the \"sea floor spreading\". Hess argued that constant eruptions at the crest of oceanic ridges cause the rupture of the oceanic crust and the new lava wedges into it, pushing the oceanic crust on either side. The ocean floor, thus spreads. The younger age of the oceanic crust as well as the fact that the spreading of one ocean does not cause the shrinking of the other, made Hess",

      "content": "concept termed Plate Tectonics. A tectonic plate (also called lithospheric plate) is a massive, irregularly-shaped slab of solid rock, generally composed of both continental and oceanic lithosphere. Plates move horizontally over the asthenosphere as rigid units. The lithosphere includes the crust and top mantle with its thickness range varying between 5 and 100 km in oceanic parts and about 200 km in the continental areas. A plate may be referred to as the continental plate or oceanic plate depending on which of the two occupy a larger portion of the plate. Pacific plate is largely an oceanic plate whereas the Eurasian plate may be called a continental plate. The theory of plate tectonics proposes that the earth's lithosphere is divided into seven major and some minor plates. Young Fold Mountain ridges, trenches, and/or faults surround these major plates (Figure 4.5). The major plates are as follows :\n\nI Antarctica and the surrounding oceanic plate\nII North American (with western Atlantic floor separated from the South American plate along the Caribbean islands) plate\nIII South American (with western Atlantic floor separated from the North American plate along the Caribbean islands) plate\nIV Pacific plate\nV India-Australia-New Zealand plate\nVI Africa with the eastern Atlantic floor plate\nVII Eurasia and the adjacent oceanic plate. Some important minor plates are listed below:\n(i) Cocos plate : Between Central America and Pacific plate\n(ii) Nazca plate : Between South America and Pacific plate\n(iii) Arabian plate : Mostly the Saudi Arabian landmass\n(iv) Philippine plate : Between the Asiatic and Pacific plate\n\n\n**[IMAGE: A diagram showing the major tectonic plates of the Earth and their boundaries.]**\n\n\n\nFigure 4.5 : Major and minor plates of the world",

      "content": "(v) Caroline plate : Between the Philippine and Indian plate (North of New Guinea)\nThese plates have been constantly moving over the globe throughout the history of the earth. It is not the continent that moves as believed by Wegener. Continents are part of a plate and what moves is the plate. Moreover, it may be noted that all the plates, without exception, have moved in the geological past, and shall continue to move in the future as well. Wegener had thought of all the continents to have initially existed as a super continent in the form of Pangaea. However, later discoveries reveal that the continental masses, resting on the plates, have been wandering all through the geological period, and Pangaea was a result of converging of different continental masses that were parts of one or the other plates. Scientists using the palaeomagnetic data have determined the positions held by each of the present continental landmass in different geological periods (Fig 4.4). Position of the Indian subcontinent (mostly Peninsular India) is traced with the help of the rocks analysed from the Nagpur area.\n\nThere are three types of plate boundaries:\n\n## Divergent Boundaries\n\nWhere new crust is generated as the plates pull away from each other. The sites where the plates move away from each other are called spreading sites. The best-known example of divergent boundaries is the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. At this, the American Plate(s) is/are separated from the Eurasian and African Plates.\n\n## Convergent Boundaries\n\nWhere the crust is destroyed as one plate dived under another. The location where sinking of a plate occurs is called a subduction zone. There are three ways in which convergence can occur. These are: (i) between an oceanic and continental plate; (ii) between two oceanic plates; and (iii) between two continental plates.\n\n## Transform Boundaries\n\nWhere the crust is neither produced nor destroyed as the plates slide horizontally past each other. Transform faults are the planes of separation generally perpendicular to the midoceanic ridges. As the eruptions do not take all along the entire crest at the same time, there is a differential movement of a portion of the plate away from the axis of the earth. Also, the rotation of the earth has its effect on the separated blocks of the plate portions.\n\nHow do you think the rate of plate movement is determined?\n\n## Rates of Plate Movement\n\nThe strips of normal and reverse magnetic field that parallel the mid-oceanic ridges help scientists determine the rates of plate movement. These rates vary considerably. The Arctic Ridge has the slowest rate (less than 2.5 $\\mathrm{cm} / \\mathrm{yr}$ ), and the East Pacific Rise near Easter Island, in the South Pacific about 3,400 km west of Chile, has the fastest rate (more than $15 \\mathrm{~cm} / \\mathrm{yr}$ ).\n\n## Force for the Plate Movement\n\nAt the time that Wegener proposed his theory of continental drift, most scientists believed that the earth was a solid, motionless body. However, concepts of sea floor spreading and the unified theory of plate tectonics have emphasised that both the surface of the earth and the interior are not static and motionless but are dynamic. The fact that the plates move is now a well-accepted fact. The mobile rock beneath the rigid plates is believed to be moving in a circular manner. The heated material rises to the surface, spreads and begins to cool, and then sinks back into deeper depths. This cycle is repeated over and over to generate what scientists call a convection cell or convective flow. Heat within the earth comes from two main sources: radioactive decay and residual heat.

The slow movement of hot, softened mantle that lies below the rigid plates is the driving force behind the plate movement.\n\n## Movement of the Indian Plate\n\nThe Indian plate includes Peninsular India and the Australian continental portions. The subduction zone along the Himalayas forms the northern plate boundary in the form of continent - continent convergence. In the east, it extends through Rakinyoma Mountains of Myanmar towards the island arc along the Java Trench. The eastern margin is a spreading site lying to the east of Australia in the form of an oceanic ridge in SW Pacific. The Western margin follows Kirthar Mountain of Pakistan. It further extends along the Makrana coast and joins the spreading site from the Red Sea rift southeastward along the Chagos Archipelago. The boundary between India and the Antarctic plate is also marked by oceanic ridge (divergent boundary) running in roughly W-E direction and merging into the spreading site, a little south of New Zealand.\n\nIndia was a large island situated off the Australian coast, in a vast ocean. The Tethys Sea separated it from the Asian continent till about 225 million years ago. India is supposed to have started her northward journey about 200 million years ago at the time when Pangaea broke. India collided with Asia about 40-50 million years ago causing rapid uplift of the Himalayas. The positions of India since about 71 million years till the present are shown in the Figure 4.6. It also shows the position of the Indian subcontinent and the Eurasian plate. About 140 million years before the present, the subcontinent was located as south as $50^{\\circ} \\mathrm{S}$. latitude. The two major plates were separated by the Tethys Sea and the Tibetan block was closer to the Asiatic landmass.

This started somewhere around 60 million years ago and continued for a long period of time. Note that the subcontinent was still close to the equator. From 40 million years ago and thereafter, the event of formation of the Himalayas took place. Scientists believe that the process is still continuing and the height of the Himalayas is rising even to this date.",

Let us start with this question.\n\n## Why is the surface of the earth uneven?\n\nThe earth's crust is dynamic. You are well aware that it has moved and moves vertically and horizontally. Of course, it moved a bit faster in the past than the rate at which it is moving now. The differences in the internal forces operating from within the earth which built up the crust have been responsible for the variations in the outer surface of the crust. The earth's surface is being continuously subjected to external forces induced basically by energy (sunlight). Of course, the internal forces are still active though with different intensities. That means, the earth's surface is being continuously subjected to by external forces originating within the earth's atmosphere and by internal forces from within the earth. The external forces are known as exogenic forces and the internal forces are known as endogenic forces. The actions of exogenic forces result in wearing down (degradation) of relief/elevations and filling up (aggradation) of basins/ depressions, on the earth's surface. The phenomenon of wearing down of relief variations of the surface of the earth through erosion is known as gradation. The endogenic\nforces continuously elevate or build up parts of the earth's surface and hence the exogenic processes fail to even out the relief variations of the surface of the earth. So, variations remain as long as the opposing actions of exogenic and endogenic forces continue. In general terms, the endogenic forces are mainly land building forces and the exogenic processes are mainly land wearing forces. The surface of the earth is sensitive. Humans depend on it for their sustenance and have been using it extensively and intensively. So, it is essential to understand its nature in order to use it effectively without disturbing its balance and diminishing its potential for the future. Almost all organisms contribute to sustain the earth's environment. However, humans have caused extensive damage to the environment through over use of resources. Use we must, but must also leave it potential enough to sustain life through the future. Most of the surface of the earth had and has been shaped over very long periods of time (hundreds and thousands of years) and because of its use and misuse by humans its potential is being diminished at a fast rate. If the processes which shaped and are shaping the surface of the earth into varieties of forms (shapes) and the nature of materials of which it is composed of, are understood, precautions can be taken to minimise the detrimental effects of human use and to preserve it for posterity.\n\n## GEOMORPHIC PROCESSES\n\nYou would like to know the meaning of geomorphic processes.

      "content": "bringing about changes in the configuration of the surface of the earth are known as geomorphic processes. Diastrophism and volcanism are endogenic geomorphic processes. These have already been discussed in brief in the preceding unit. Weathering, mass wasting, erosion and deposition are exogenic geomorphic processes. These exogenic processes are dealt with in detail in this chapter.\n\nAny exogenic element of nature (like water, ice, wind, etc.,) capable of acquiring and transporting earth materials can be called a geomorphic agent. When these elements of nature become mobile due to gradients, they remove the materials and transport them over slopes and deposit them at lower level. Geomorphic processes and geomorphic agents especially exogenic, unless stated separately, are one and the same.\n\nA process is a force applied on earth materials affecting the same. An agent is a mobile medium (like running water, moving ice masses, wind, waves and currents etc.) which removes, transports and deposits earth materials. Running water, groundwater, glaciers, wind, waves and currents, etc., can be called geomorphic agents.\n\nDo you think it is essential to distinguish geomorphic agents and geomorphic processes?\n\nGravity besides being a directional force activating all downslope movements of matter also causes stresses on the earth's materials. Indirect gravitational stresses activate wave and tide induced currents and winds. Without gravity and gradients there would be no mobility and hence no erosion, transportation and deposition are possible. So, gravitational stresses are as important as the other geomorphic processes. Gravity is the force that is keeping us in contact with the surface and it is the force that switches on the movement of all surface material on earth. All the movements either within the earth or on the surface of the earth occur due to gradients - from higher levels to lower levels, from high pressure to low pressure areas etc.\n\n## Endogenic Processes\n\nThe energy emanating from within the earth is the main force behind endogenic geomorphic processes. This energy is mostly generated by radioactivity, rotational and tidal friction and primordial heat from the origin of the earth. This energy due to geothermal gradients and heat flow from within induces diastrophism and volcanism in the lithosphere. Due to variations in geothermal gradients and heat flow from within, crustal thickness and strength, the action of endogenic forces are not uniform and hence the tectonically controlled original crustal surface is uneven.\n\n## Diastrophism\n\nAll processes that move, elevate or build up portions of the earth's crust come under diastrophism. They include: (i) orogenic processes involving mountain building through severe folding and affecting long and narrow belts of the earth's crust; (ii) epeirogenic processes involving uplift or warping of large parts of the earth's crust; (iii) earthquakes involving local relatively minor movements; (iv) plate tectonics involving horizontal movements of crustal plates.\n\nIn the process of orogeny, the crust is severely deformed into folds. Due to epeirogeny, there may be simple deformation. Orogeny is a mountain building process whereas epeirogeny is continental building process. Through the processes of orogeny, epeirogeny, earthquakes and plate tectonics, there can be faulting and fracturing of the crust. All these processes cause pressure, volume and temperature (PVT) changes which in turn induce metamorphism of rocks.\n\nEpeirogeny and orogeny, cite the differences.\n\n## Volcanism\n\nVolcanism includes the movement of molten rock (magma) onto or toward the earth's surface and also formation of many intrusive and extrusive volcanic forms. Many aspects of volcanism have already been dealt in detail",

Force applied per unit area is called stress. Stress is produced in a solid by pushing or pulling. This induces deformation. Forces acting along the faces of earth materials are shear stresses (separating forces). It is this stress that breaks rocks and other earth materials. The shear stresses result in angular displacement or slippage. Besides the gravitational stress earth materials become subjected to molecular stresses that may be caused by a number of factors amongst which temperature changes, crystallisation and melting are the most common. Chemical processes normally lead to loosening of bonds between grains, dissolving of soluble minerals or cementing materials. Thus, the basic reason that leads to weathering, mass movements, and erosion is development of stresses in the body of the earth materials.\n\nTemperature and precipitation are the two important climatic elements that control various processes.\n\nAll the exogenic geomorphic processes are covered under a general term, denudation. The word 'denude' means to strip off or to uncover. Weathering, mass wasting/movements, erosion and transportation are included in denudation. The flow chart (Figure 5.1) gives the denudation processes and their respective\ndriving forces. It should become clear from this chart that for each process there exists a distinct driving force or energy.\n\nAs there are different climatic regions owing to variations in thermal gradients created by latitudinal, seasonal, and land and water spread on the surface of the earth, the exogenic geomorphic processes vary from region to region. The density, type and distribution of vegetation which largely depend upon precipitation and temperature also exert\n\n\n**[IMAGE: A diagram illustrating the denudational processes including weathering, mass movements, and erosion/transportation.]**\n\n\n\nFigure 5.1 : Denudational processes and their driving forces\ninfluence indirectly on exogenic geomorphic processes. Within different climatic regions there may be local variations of the effects of different climatic elements due to altitudinal differences, aspect variations and the variation in the amount of insolation received by north and south facing slopes as compared to east and west facing slopes. Further, due to differences in wind velocities and directions, amount and kind of precipitation, its intensity, the relation between precipitation and evaporation, daily range of temperature, freezing and thawing frequency, depth of frost penetration, the geomorphic processes vary within any climatic region.\n\nWhat is the sole driving force behind all the exogenic processes?\n\nClimatic factors being equal, the intensity of action of exogenic geomorphic processes depends upon type and structure of rocks. The term structure includes such aspects of rocks as folds, faults, orientation and inclination of beds, presence or absence of joints, bedding planes, hardness or softness of constituent minerals, chemical susceptibility of mineral constituents; the permeability or impermeability",

A particular rock may be resistant to one process and nonresistant to another.

The effects of most of the exogenic geomorphic processes are small and slow and may be imperceptible in a short time span, but will in the long run affect the rocks severely due to continued fatigue.\n\nFinally, it boils down to one fact that the differences on the surface of the earth though originally related to the crustal evolution continue to exist in some form or the other due to differences in the type and structure of earth materials, differences in geomorphic processes and in their rates of operation.\n\nSome of the exogenic geomorphic processes have been dealt in detail here.\n\n## Weathering\n\nWeathering is action of elements of weather and climate over earth materials. There are a number of processes within weathering which act either individually or together to affect the earth materials in order to reduce them to fragmental state.\n\nWeathering is defined as mechanical disintegration and chemical decomposition of rocks through the actions of various elements of weather and climate.\n\nAs very little or no motion of materials takes place in weathering, it is an in-situ or on-site process.\n\nIs this little motion which can occur sometimes due to weathering synonymous with transportation? If not, why?\n\nWeathering processes are conditioned by many complex geological, climatic, topographic and vegetative factors. Climate is of particular importance. Not only weathering processes differ from climate to climate, but also the depth of the weathering mantle (Figure 5.2).\n\n\n**[IMAGE: A diagram showing the relationship between precipitation, temperature, and soil types across different vegetation zones.]**\n\n\n\nFigure 5.2 : Climatic regimes and depth of weathering mantles (adapted and modified from Strakhov, 1967)\n\n## Activity\n\nMark the latitude values of different climatic regimes in Figure 6.2 and compare the details.\n\nThere are three major groups of weathering processes : (i) chemical; (ii) physical or mechanical; (iii) biological weathering processes. Very rarely does any one of these processes ever operate completely by itself, but quite often a dominance of one process can be seen.\n\n## Chemical Weathering Processes\n\nA group of weathering processes viz; solution, carbonation, hydration, oxidation and reduction act on the rocks to decompose, dissolve or reduce them to a fine clastic state through chemical reactions by oxygen, surface and/or soil water and other acids. Water and air (oxygen and carbon dioxide) along with heat must be present to speed up all chemical reactions. Over and above the carbon dioxide present in the air, decomposition of plants and animals increases the quantity of carbon dioxide underground. These chemical reactions on various minerals are very much similar to the chemical reactions in a laboratory.\n\n## Physical Weathering Processes\n\nPhysical or mechanical weathering processes depend on some applied forces.

      "content": "forces could be: (i) gravitational forces such as overburden pressure, load and shearing stress; (ii) expansion forces due to temperature changes, crystal growth or animal activity; (iii) water pressures controlled by wetting and drying cycles. Many of these forces are applied both at the surface and within different earth materials leading to rock fracture. Most of the physical weathering processes are caused by thermal expansion and pressure release. These processes are small and slow but can cause great damage to the rocks because of continued fatigue the rocks suffer due to repetition of contraction and expansion.\n\n## Biological Activity and Weathering\n\nBiological weathering is contribution to or removal of minerals and ions from the weathering environment and physical changes due to growth or movement of organisms. Burrowing and wedging by organisms like earthworms, termites, rodents etc., help in exposing the new surfaces to chemical attack and assists in the penetration of moisture and air. Human beings by disturbing vegetation, ploughing and cultivating soils, also help in mixing and creating new contacts between air, water and minerals in the earth materials. Decaying plant and animal matter help in the production of humic, carbonic and other acids which enhance decay and solubility of some elements. Plant roots exert a tremendous pressure on the earth materials mechanically breaking them apart.\n\n## Special Effects of Weathering\n\n## Exfoliation\n\nThis has already been explained under physical weathering processes of unloading, thermal contraction and expansion and salt weathering. Exfoliation is a result but not a process. Flaking off of more or less curved sheets of shells from over rocks or bedrock results in smooth and rounded surfaces (Figure 5.3). Exfoliation can occur due to expansion and contraction induced by temperature changes. Exfoliation domes and tors result due to unloading and thermal expansion respectively.\n\n\n**[IMAGE: A photograph showing a close-up view of a rocky terrain with a compass for scale.]**\n\n\n\nFig.5.3 : Exfoliation (Flacking) and granular disintegration\n\n## Significance of Weathering\n\nWeathering processes are responsible for breaking down the rocks into smaller fragments and preparing the way for formation of not only regolith and soils, but also erosion and mass movements. Biomes and bio-diversity is basically a result of forests (vegetation) and forests depend upon the depth of weathering mantles. Erosion cannot be significant if the rocks are not weathered. That means, weathering aids mass wasting, erosion and reduction of relief and changes in landforms are a consequence of erosion. Weathering of rocks and deposits helps in the enrichment and concentrations of certain valuable ores of iron, manganese, aluminium, copper etc., which are of great importance for the national economy. Weathering is an important process in the formation of soils.\n\nWhen rocks undergo weathering, some materials are removed through chemical or physical leaching by groundwater and thereby the concentration of remaining (valuable) materials increases. Without such a weathering taking place, the concentration of the same valuable material may not be sufficient and economically viable to exploit, process and refine. This is what is called enrichment.\n\n## Mass Movements\n\nThese movements transfer the mass of rock debris down the slopes under the direct influence of gravity. That means, air, water or",

The movements of mass may range from slow to rapid, affecting shallow to deep columns of materials and include creep, flow, slide and fall. Gravity exerts its force on all matter, both bedrock and the products of weathering. So, weathering is not a pre-requisite for mass movement though it aids mass movements. Mass movements are very active over weathered slopes rather than over unweathered materials.\n\nMass movements are aided by gravity and no geomorphic agent like running water, glaciers, wind, waves and currents participate in the process of mass movements. That means mass movements do not come under erosion though there is a shift (aided by gravity) of materials from one place to another. Materials over the slopes have their own resistance to disturbing forces and will yield only when force is greater than the shearing resistance of the materials. Weak unconsolidated materials, thinly bedded rocks, faults, steeply dipping beds, vertical cliffs or steep slopes, abundant precipitation and torrential rains and scarcity of vegetation etc., favour mass movements.\n\nSeveral activating causes precede mass movements. They are : (i) removal of support from below to materials above through natural or artificial means; (ii) increase in gradient and height of slopes; (iii) overloading through addition of materials naturally or by artificial filling; (iv) overloading due to heavy rainfall, saturation and lubrication of slope materials; (v) removal of material or load from over the original slope surfaces; (vi) occurrence of earthquakes, explosions or machinery; (vii) excessive natural seepage; (viii) heavy drawdown of water from lakes, reservoirs and rivers leading to slow outflow of water from under the slopes or river banks; (ix) indiscriminate removal of natural vegetation.\n\nHeave (heaving up of soils due to frost growth and other causes), flow and slide are the three forms of movements. Figure 5.5 shows\nthe relationships among different types of mass movements, their relative rates of movement and moisture limits.\n\n## Landslides\n\nThese are relatively rapid and perceptible movements. The materials involved are relatively dry. The size and shape of the detached mass depends on the nature of discontinuities in the rock, the degree of weathering and the steepness of the slope. Depending upon the type of movement of materials several types are identified in this category.\n\nSlump is slipping of one or several units of rock debris with a backward rotation with respect to the slope over which the movement takes place (Figure 5.4). Rapid rolling or sliding\n\n\n**[IMAGE: Diagram showing the initial position of a slope and the slump body indicating backward rotation of materials.]**\n\n\n\nFigure 5.4 : Slumping of debris with backward rotation of earth debris without backward rotation of mass is known as debris slide. Debris fall is nearly a free fall of earth debris from a vertical or overhanging face. Sliding of individual rock masses down bedding, joint or fault surfaces is rockslide. Over steep slopes, rock sliding is very fast and destructive. Figure 5.5 shows landslide scars over steep slopes.

Rock falls occur from the superficial layers of the rock face, an occurrence that distinguishes it from rockslide which affects materials up to a substantial depth.\n\nBetween mass wasting and mass movements, which term do you feel is most appropriate? Why? Can solifluction be included under rapid flow movements? Why it can be and can't be?\n\nIn our country, debris avalanches and landslides occur very frequently in the Himalayas. There are many reasons for this. One, the Himalayas are tectonically active. They are mostly made up of sedimentary rocks and unconsolidated and semi-consolidated deposits. The slopes are very steep. Compared to the Himalayas, the Nilgiris bordering Tamilnadu, Karnataka, Kerala and the Western Ghats along the west coast are relatively tectonically stable and are mostly made up of very hard rocks; but, still, debris avalanches and landslides occur though not as frequently as in the Himalayas, in these hills. Why? Many slopes are steeper with almost vertical cliffs and escarpments in the Western Ghats and Nilgiris. Mechanical weathering due to temperature changes and ranges is pronounced. They receive heavy amounts of rainfall over short periods. So, there is almost direct rock fall quite frequently in these places along with landslides and debris avalanches.\n\n## Erosion and Deposition\n\nErosion involves acquisition and transportation of rock debris. When massive rocks break into smaller fragments through weathering and any other process, erosional geomorphic agents like running water, groundwater, glaciers, wind and waves remove and transport it to other places depending upon the dynamics of each of these agents. Abrasion\nby rock debris carried by these geomorphic agents also aids greatly in erosion. By erosion, relief degrades, i.e., the landscape is worn down. That means, though weathering aids erosion it is not a pre-condition for erosion to take place. Weathering, mass-wasting and erosion are degradational processes. It is erosion that is largely responsible for continuous changes that the earth's surface is undergoing. As indicated in Figure 6.1, denudational processes like erosion and transportation are controlled by kinetic energy. The erosion and transportation of earth materials is brought about by wind, running water, glaciers, waves and ground water. Of these the first three agents are controlled by climatic conditions. They represent three states of matter - gaseous (wind), liquid (running water) and solid (glacier) respectively.\n\nCan you compare the three climatically controlled agents?\n\nThe work of the other two agents of erosion-waves and ground water is not controlled by climate. In case of waves it is the location along the interface of litho and hydro sphere - coastal region - that will determine the work of waves, whereas the work of ground water is determined more by the lithological character of the region. If the rocks are permeable and soluble and water is available only then karst topography develops. In the next chapter we shall be dealing with the landforms produced by each of these agents of erosion.\n\nDeposition is a consequence of erosion. The erosional agents loose their velocity and hence energy on gentler slopes and the materials carried by them start to settle themselves. In other words, deposition is not actually the work of any agent. The coarser materials get deposited first and finer ones later. By deposition depressions get filled up. The same erosional agents viz., running water, glaciers, wind, waves and groundwater act as aggradational or depositional agents also.\n\nWhat happens to the surface of the earth due to erosion and deposition is elaborated",

So, why can't both be treated as one and the same? Can there be appreciable erosion without rocks undergoing weathering?\n\n## Soil Formation\n\nYou see plants growing in soils. You play in the ground and come into contact with soil. You touch and feel soil and soil your clothes while playing. Can you describe it?\n\nSoil is a dynamic medium in which many chemical, physical and biological activities go on constantly. Soil is a result of decay, it is also the medium for growth. It is a changing and developing body. It has many characteristics that fluctuate with the seasons. It may be alternatively cold and warm or dry and moist. Biological activity is slowed or stopped if the soil becomes too cold or too dry. Organic matter increases when leaves fall or grasses die.\n\n## Process of Soil Formation\n\nSoil formation or pedogenesis depends first on weathering. It is this weathering mantle (depth of the weathered material) which is the basic input for soil to form. First, the weathered material or transported deposits are colonised by bacteria and other inferior plant bodies like mosses and lichens. Also, several minor organisms may take shelter within the mantle and deposits. The dead remains of organisms and plants help in humus accumulation. Minor grasses and ferns may grow; later, bushes and trees will start growing through seeds brought in by birds and wind. Plant roots penetrate down, burrowing animals bring up particles, mass of material becomes porous and sponge-like with a capacity to retain water and to permit the passage of air and finally a mature soil, a complex mixture of mineral and organic products forms.\n\nIs weathering solely responsible for soil formation? If not, why?\n\nPedology is soil science. A pedologist is a soil-scientist.\n\n## Soil-forming Factors\n\nFive basic factors control the formation of soils: (i) parent material; (ii) topography; (iii) climate; (iv) biological activity; (v) time. In fact soil forming factors act in union and affect the action of one another.\n\n## Parent Material\n\nParent material is a passive control factor in soil formation. Parent materials can be any in-situ or on-site weathered rock debris (residual soils) or transported deposits (transported soils). Soil formation depends upon the texture (sizes of debris) and structure (disposition of individual grains/particles of debris) as well as the mineral and chemical composition of the rock debris/deposits.\n\nNature and rate of weathering and depth of weathering mantle are important considerations under parent materials. There may be differences in soil over similar bedrock and dissimilar bedrocks may have similar soils above them. But when soils are very young and have not matured these show strong links with the type of parent rock. Also, in case of some limestone areas, where the weathering processes are specific and peculiar, soils will show clear relation with the parent rock.\n\n## Topography\n\nTopography like parent materials is another passive control factor. The influence of topography is felt through the amount of exposure of a surface covered by parent materials to sunlight and the amount of surface and sub-surface drainage over and through the parent materials. Soils will be thin on steep slopes and thick over flat upland areas. Over gentle slopes where erosion is slow and percolation of water is good, soil formation is",

      "content": "very favourable. Soils over flat areas may develop a thick layer of clay with good accumulation of organic matter giving the soil dark colour.\n\n## Climate\n\nClimate is an important active factor in soil formation. The climatic elements involved in soil development are : (i) moisture in terms of its intensity, frequency and duration of precipitation-evaporation and humidity; (ii) temperature in terms of seasonal and diurnal variations.\n\nPrecipitation gives soil its moisture content which makes the chemical and biological activities possible. Excess of water helps in the downward transportation of soil components through the soil (eluviation) and deposits the same down below (illuviation). In climates like wet equatorial rainy areas with high rainfall, not only calcium, sodium, magnesium, potassium etc. but also a major part of silica is removed from the soil. Removal of silica from the soil is known as desilication. In dry climates, because of high temperature, evaporation exceeds precipitation and hence ground water is brought up to the surface by capillary action and in the process the water evaporates leaving behind salts in the soil. Such salts form into a crust in the soil known as hardpans. In tropical climates and in areas with intermediate precipitation conditions, calcium carbonate nodules (kanker) are formed.\n\nTemperature acts in two ways - increasing or reducing chemical and biological activity. Chemical activity is increased in higher temperatures, reduced in cooler temperatures (with an exception of carbonation) and stops in freezing conditions. That is why, tropical soils with higher temperatures show deeper profiles and in the frozen tundra regions soils contain largely mechanically broken materials.\n\n## Biological Activity\n\nThe vegetative cover and organisms that occupy the parent materials from the beginning and also at later stages help in adding organic matter, moisture retention, nitrogen etc. Dead plants provide humus, the finely divided organic matter\nof the soil. Some organic acids which form during humification aid in decomposing the minerals of the soil parent materials.\n\nIntensity of bacterial activity shows up differences between soils of cold and warm climates. Humus accumulates in cold climates as bacterial growth is slow. With undecomposed organic matter because of low bacterial activity, layers of peat develop in subarctic and tundra climates. In humid tropical and equatorial climates, bacterial growth and action is intense and dead vegetation is rapidly oxidised leaving very low humus content in the soil. Further, bacteria and other soil organisms take gaseous nitrogen from the air and convert it into a chemical form that can be used by plants. This process is known as nitrogen fixation. Rhizobium, a type of bacteria, lives in the root nodules of leguminous plants and fixes nitrogen beneficial to the host plant. The influence of large animals like ants, termites, earthworms, rodents etc., is mechanical, but, it is nevertheless important in soil formation as they rework the soil up and down. In case of earthworms, as they feed on soil, the texture and chemistry of the soil that comes out of their body changes.\n\n## Time\n\nTime is the third important controlling factor in soil formation. The length of time the soil forming processes operate, determines maturation of soils and profile development. A soil becomes mature when all soil-forming processes act for a sufficiently long time developing a profile. Soils developing from recently deposited alluvium or glacial till are considered young and they exhibit no horizons or only poorly developed horizons. No specific length of time in absolute terms can be fixed for soils to develop and mature.\n\nIs it necessary to separate the process of soil formation and the soil forming control factors?\n\nWhy are time, topography and parent material considered as passive control factors in soil formation?",

It is already known to you that erosion causes changes on the surface of the earth. Deposition follows erosion and because of deposition too, changes occur on the surface of the earth.\n\nAs this chapter deals with landforms and their evolution 'first' start with the question, what is a landform? In simple words, small to medium tracts or parcels of the earth's surface are called landforms.\n\nIf landform is a small to medium sized part of the surface of the earth, what is a landscape?\n\nSeveral related landforms together make up landscapes, (large tracts of earth's surface). Each landform has its own physical shape, size, materials and is a result of the action of certain geomorphic processes and agent(s). Actions of most of the geomorphic processes and agents are slow, and hence the results take a long time to take shape. Every landform has a beginning. Landforms once formed may change in their shape, size and nature slowly or fast due to continued action of geomorphic processes and agents.\n\nDue to changes in climatic conditions and vertical or horizontal movements of landmasses, either the intensity of processes or the processes themselves might change leading to new modifications in the landforms. Evolution here implies stages of transformation of either a\npart of the earth's surface from one landform into another or transformation of individual landforms after they are once formed. That means, each and every landform has a history of development and changes through time. A landmass passes through stages of development somewhat comparable to the stages of life youth, mature and old age.\n\nWhat are the two important aspects of the evolution of landforms?\n\n## Running Water\n\nIn humid regions, which receive heavy rainfall running water is considered the most important of the geomorphic agents in bringing about the degradation of the land surface. There are two components of running water. One is overland flow on general land surface as a sheet. Another is linear flow as streams and rivers in valleys. Most of the erosional landforms made by running water are associated with vigorous and youthful rivers flowing over steep gradients. With time, stream channels over steep gradients turn gentler due to continued erosion, and as a consequence, lose their velocity, facilitating active deposition. There may be depositional forms associated with streams flowing over steep slopes. But these phenomena will be on a small scale compared to those associated with rivers flowing over medium to gentle slopes. The gentler the river channels in gradient or slope, the greater is the deposition. When the stream beds turn gentler due to continued erosion, downward",

      "content": "cutting becomes less dominant and lateral erosion of banks increases and as a consequence the hills and valleys are reduced to plains.\n\nIs complete reduction of relief of a high land mass possible?\n\nOverland flow causes sheet erosion. Depending upon irregularities of the land surface, the overland flow may concentrate into narrow to wide paths. Because of the sheer friction of the column of flowing water, minor or major quantities of materials from the surface of the land are removed in the direction of flow and gradually small and narrow rills will form. These rills will gradually develop into long and wide gullies; the gullies will further deepen, widen, lengthen and unite to give rise to a network of valleys. In the early stages, down-cutting dominates during which irregularities such as waterfalls and cascades will be removed. In the middle stages, streams cut their beds slower, and lateral erosion of valley sides becomes severe. Gradually, the valley sides are reduced to lower and lower slopes. The divides between drainage basins are likewise lowered until they are almost completely flattened leaving finally, a lowland of faint relief with some low resistant remnants called monadnocks standing out here and there. This type of plain forming as a result of stream erosion is called a peneplain (an almost plain). The characteristics of each of the stages of landscapes developing in running water regimes may be summarised as follows:\n\n## Youth\n\nStreams are few during this stage with poor integration and flow over original slopes showing shallow V-shaped valleys with no floodplains or with very narrow floodplains along trunk streams. Streams divides are broad and flat with marshes, swamp and lakes. Meanders if present develop over these broad upland surfaces. These meanders may eventually entrench themselves into the uplands. Waterfalls and rapids may exist where local hard rock bodies are exposed.\n\n## Mature\n\nDuring this stage streams are plenty with good integration. The valleys are still V-shaped but deep; trunk streams are broad enough to have wider floodplains within which streams may flow in meanders confined within the valley. The flat and broad inter stream areas and swamps and marshes of youth disappear and the stream divides turn sharp. Waterfalls and rapids disappear.\n\n## Old\n\nSmaller tributaries during old age are few with gentle gradients. Streams meander freely over vast floodplains showing natural levees, oxbow lakes, etc. Divides are broad and flat with lakes, swamps and marshes. Most of the landscape is at or slightly above sea level.\n\n## EROSIONAL LANDFORMS\n\n## Valleys\n\nValleys start as small and narrow rills; the rills will gradually develop into long and wide gullies; the gullies will further deepen, widen and lengthen to give rise to valleys. Depending upon dimensions and shape, many types of valleys like V-shaped valley, gorge, canyon, etc. can be recognised. A gorge is a deep valley with very steep to straight sides (Figure 6.1) and a canyon is characterised by steep step-like side slopes (Figure 6.2) and may be as deep as a gorge. A gorge is almost equal in width at its top as well as its bottom. In contrast, a canyon is wider at its top than at its bottom. In fact, a canyon is a variant of gorge. Valley types depend upon the type and structure of rocks in which they form. For example, canyons commonly form in horizontal bedded sedimentary rocks and gorges form in hard rocks.\n\n## Potholes and Plunge Pools\n\nOver the rocky beds of hill-streams more or less circular depressions called potholes form because of stream erosion aided by the abrasion of rock fragments.

A series of such depressions eventually join and the stream valley gets deepened. At the foot of\nwaterfalls also, large potholes, quite deep and wide, form because of the sheer impact of water and rotation of boulders. Such large and deep holes at the base of waterfalls are called plunge pools.\n\n## Incised or Entrenched Meanders\n\nIn streams that flow rapidly over steep gradients, normally erosion is concentrated on the bottom of the stream channel. Also, in the case of steep gradient streams, lateral erosion on the sides of the valleys is not much when compared to the streams flowing on low and gentle slopes. Because of active lateral erosion, streams flowing over gentle slopes, develop sinuous or meandering courses. It is common to find meandering courses over floodplains and delta plains where stream gradients are very gentle. But very deep and wide meanders can also be found cut in hard rocks. Such meanders are called incised or entrenched meanders (Figure 6.2).\n\n## River Terraces\n\nRiver terraces are surfaces marking old valley floor or floodplain levels. They may be bedrock surfaces without any alluvial cover or alluvial terraces consisting of stream deposits. River terraces are basically products of erosion as they result due to vertical erosion by the stream into its own depositional floodplain. There can be a number of such terraces at different heights indicating former river bed levels. The river terraces may occur at the same elevation on either side of the rivers in which case they are called paired terraces.\n\n## Depositional Landforms\n\n## Alluvial Fans\n\nAlluvial fans (Figure 6.3) are formed when streams flowing from higher levels break into foot slope plains of low gradient.

Usually, the streams which flow over fans are not confined to their original channels for long and shift their position across the fan forming many channels called distributaries. Alluvial fans in humid areas show normally low cones with gentle slope from head to toe and they appear as high cones with steep slope in arid and semi-arid climates.\n\n\n**[IMAGE: A photograph of a winding road in a mountainous region.]**\n\n\n\nFigure 6.3 : An alluvial fan deposited by a hill stream on the way to Amarnath, Jammu and Kashmir\n\n## Deltas\n\nDeltas are like alluvial fans but develop at a different location. The load carried by the rivers is dumped and spread into the sea. If this load is not carried away far into the sea or distributed along the coast, it spreads and\n\n\n**[IMAGE: A diagram of the circulatory system showing the flow of blood through the veins and arteries.]**\n\n\n\nFigure 6.4 : A satellite view of part of Krishna river delta, Andhra Pradesh\naccumulates as a low cone. Unlike in alluvial fans, the deposits making up deltas are very well sorted with clear stratification. The coarsest materials settle out first and the finer fractions like silts and clays are carried out into the sea. As the delta grows, the river distributaries continue to increase in length (Figure 6.4) and delta continues to build up into the sea.\n\n## Floodplains, Natural Levees and Point Bars\n\nDeposition develops a floodplain just as erosion makes valleys. Floodplain is a major landform of river deposition. Large sized materials are deposited first when stream channel breaks into a gentle slope. Thus, normally, fine sized materials like sand, silt and clay are carried by relatively slow moving waters in gentler channels usually found in the plains and deposited over the bed and when the waters spill over the banks during flooding above the bed. A river bed made of river deposits is the active floodplain. The floodplain above the bank is inactive floodplain. Inactive floodplain above the banks basically contain two types of deposits - flood deposits and channel deposits. In plains, channels shift laterally and change their courses occasionally leaving cut-off courses which get filled up gradually. Such areas over flood plains built up by abandoned or cut-off channels contain coarse deposits. The flood deposits of spilled waters carry relatively finer materials like silt and clay. The flood plains in a delta are called delta plains.\n\n\n**[IMAGE: A diagram illustrating the formation of point bars and natural levees in a meandering river.]**\n\n\n\nFigure 6.5 : Natural levee and point bars",

      "content": "Natural levees and point bars (Figure 6.5) are some of the important landforms found associated with floodplains. Natural levees are found along the banks of large rivers. They are low, linear and parallel ridges of coarse deposits along the banks of rivers, quite often cut into individual mounds. Point bars are also known as meander bars. They are found on the concave side of meanders of large rivers and are sediments deposited in a linear fashion by flowing waters along the bank. They are almost uniform in profile and in width and contain mixed sizes of sediments.\n\nIn what way do natural levees differ from point bars?\n\n## Meanders\n\nIn large flood and delta plains, rivers rarely flow in straight courses. Loop-like channel patterns called meanders develop over flood and delta plains (Figure 6.6).\n\n\n**[IMAGE: A satellite image showing a meandering river with oxbow lakes.]**\n\n\n\nFigure 6.6 : A satellite scene showing meandering Burhi Gandak river near Muzaffarpur, Bihar, showing a number of oxbow lakes and cut-offs\n\nMeander is not a landform but is only a type of channel pattern. This is because of (i) propensity of water flowing over very gentle gradients to work laterally on the banks; (ii) unconsolidated nature of alluvial deposits making up the banks with many irregularities which can be used by water exerting pressure laterally; (iii) coriolis force acting on the fluid water deflecting it like it deflects the wind. When the gradient of the channel becomes extremely low, water flows leisurely and starts working laterally. Slight irregularities along\n\n\n**[IMAGE: Diagram illustrating the formation of point bars, slip-off banks, inflection points, and oxbow lakes in a meandering river.]**\n\n\n\nFigure 6.7 : Meander growth and cut-off loops and slip-off and undercut banks\nthe banks slowly get transformed into a small curvature in the banks; the curvature deepens due to deposition on the inside of the curve and erosion along the bank on the outside. If there is no deposition and no erosion or undercutting, the tendency to meander is reduced. Normally, in meanders of large rivers, there is active deposition along the concave bank and undercutting along the convex bank. The concave bank is known as cut-off bank which shows up as a steep scarp and the convex bank presents a long, gentle profile (Figure 6.7). As meanders grow into deep loops, the same may get cut-off due to erosion at the inflection points and are left as ox-bow lakes.\n\n## Groundwater\n\nHere the interest is not on groundwater as a resource.

After vertically going down to some depth, the water under the ground flows horizontally through the bedding planes, joints or through the materials themselves. It is this downward and horizontal movement of water which causes the rocks to erode. Physical or mechanical removal of materials by moving groundwater is insignificant in developing landforms. That is why, the results of the work of groundwater cannot be seen in all types of rocks. But in rocks like limestones or dolomites rich in calcium carbonate, the surface water as well as groundwater through the chemical process of solution and precipitation deposition develop varieties of landforms. These two processes of solution and precipitation are active in limestones or dolomites occurring either exclusively or interbedded with other rocks. Any limestone or dolomitic region showing typical landforms\nproduced by the action of groundwater through the processes of solution and deposition is called Karst topography after the typical topography developed in limestone rocks of Karst region in the Balkans adjacent to Adriatic sea.\n\nThe karst topography is also characterised by erosional and depositional landforms.\n\n## EROSIONAL LANDFORMS\n\n## Pools, Sinkholes, Lapies and Limestone Pavements\n\nSmall to medium sized round to sub-rounded shallow depressions called swallow holes form on the surface of limestones through solution. Sinkholes are very common in limestone/ karst areas. A sinkhole is an opening more or less circular at the top and funnel-shaped towards the bottom with sizes varying in area from a few sq. m to a hectare and with depth",

      "content": "from a less than half a metre to thirty metres or more. Some of these form solely through solution action (solution sinks) and others might start as solution forms first and if the bottom of a sinkhole forms the roof of a void or cave underground, it might collapse leaving a large hole opening into a cave or a void below (collapse sinks). Quite often, sinkholes are covered up with soil mantle and appear as shallow water pools. Anybody stepping over such pools would go down like it happens in quicksands in deserts. The term doline is sometimes used to refer the collapse sinks. Solution sinks are more common than collapse sinks. Quite often the surface runoff simply goes down swallow and sink holes and flow as underground streams and reemerge at a distance downstream through a cave opening. When sink holes and dolines join together because of slumping of materials along their margins or due to roof collapse of caves, long, narrow to wide trenches called valley sinks or Uvalas form. Gradually, most of the surface of the limestone is eaten away by these pits and trenches, leaving it extremely irregular with a maze of points, grooves and ridges or lapies. Especially, these ridges or lapies form due to differential solution activity along parallel to sub-parallel joints. The lapie field may eventually turn into somewhat smooth limestone pavements.\n\n## Caves\n\nIn areas where there are alternating beds of rocks (shales, sandstones, quartzites) with limestones or dolomites in between or in areas where limestones are dense, massive and occurring as thick beds, cave formation is prominent. Water percolates down either through the materials or through cracks and joints and moves horizontally along bedding planes. It is along these bedding planes that the limestone dissolves and long and narrow to wide gaps called caves result. There can be a maze of caves at different elevations depending upon the limestone beds and intervening rocks. Caves normally have an opening through which cave streams are discharged. Caves having openings at both the ends are called tunnels.\n\n## Depositional Landforms\n\nMany depositional forms develop within the limestone caves. The chief chemical in limestone is calcium carbonate which is easily soluble in carbonated water (carbon dioxide absorbed rainwater). This calcium carbonate is deposited when the water carrying it in solution evaporates or loses its carbon dioxide as it trickles over rough rock surfaces.\n\n## Stalactites, Stalagmites and Pillars\n\nStalactites hang as icicles of different diameters. Normally they are broad at their bases and taper towards the free ends showing up in a variety of forms. Stalagmites rise up from the floor of the caves. In fact, stalagmites form due to dripping water from the surface or through the thin pipe, of the stalactite, immediately below it (Figure 6.9).\n\nStalagmites may take the shape of a column, a disc, with either a smooth, rounded bulging end or a miniature crater like\n\n\n**[IMAGE: Images of stalactites and stalagmites in a cave.]**\n\n\n\nFigure 6.9 : Stalactites and stalagmites in limestone caves",

The stalagmite and stalactites eventually fuse to give rise to columns and pillars of different diameters.\n\n## Glaciers\n\nMasses of ice moving as sheets over the land (continental glacier or piedmont glacier if a vast sheet of ice is spread over the plains at the foot of mountains) or as linear flows down the slopes of mountains in broad trough-like valleys (mountain and valley glaciers) are called glaciers (Figure 6.10). The movement of glaciers is slow unlike water flow. The movement could be a few centimetres to a few metres a day or even less or more. Glaciers move basically because of the force of gravity.\n\n\n**[IMAGE: A photograph of a glacial landscape with snow-covered mountains and a glacier.]**\n\n\n\nFigure 6.10 : A glacier in its valley\n\nWe have many glaciers in our country moving down the slopes and valleys in Himalayas. Higher reaches of Uttaranchal, Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir, are places to see some of them. Do you know where one can see river Bhagirathi is basically fed by meltwaters from under the snout (Gaumukh) of the Gangotri glacier. In fact, Alkapuri glacier feeds waters to Alakananda river. Rivers Alkananda and Bhagirathi join to make river Ganga near Deoprayag.\n\nErosion by glaciers is tremendous because of friction caused by sheer weight of the ice. The material plucked from the land by glaciers (usually large-sized angular blocks and\nfragments) get dragged along the floors or sides of the valleys and cause great damage through abrasion and plucking. Glaciers can cause significant damage to even un-weathered rocks and can reduce high mountains into low hills and plains.\n\nAs glaciers continue to move, debris gets removed, divides get lowered and eventually the slope is reduced to such an extent that glaciers will stop moving leaving only a mass of low hills and vast outwash plains along with other depositional features. Figures 6.11 and 6.12 show various glacial erosional and depositional forms described in the text.\n\n## EROSIONAL LANDFORMS\n\n## Cirque\n\nCirques are the most common of landforms in glaciated mountains. The cirques quite often are found at the heads of glacial valleys. The accumulated ice cuts these cirques while moving down the mountain tops. They are deep, long and wide troughs or basins with very steep concave to vertically dropping high walls at its head as well as sides. A lake of water can be seen quite often within the cirques after the glacier disappears. Such lakes are called cirque or tarn lakes. There can be two or more cirques one leading into another down below in a stepped sequence.\n\n## Horns and Serrated Ridges\n\nHorns form through head ward erosion of the cirque walls. If three or more radiating glaciers cut headward until their cirques meet, high, sharp pointed and steep sided peaks called horns form. The divides between cirque side walls or head walls get narrow because of progressive erosion and turn into serrated or saw-toothed ridges sometimes referred to as arêtes with very sharp crest and a zig-zag outline.\n\nThe highest peak in the Alps, Matterhorn and the highest peak in the Himalayas, Everest are in fact horns formed through headward erosion of radiating cirques.",

The valleys may contain littered debris or debris shaped as moraines with swampy appearance. There may be lakes gouged out of rocky floor or formed by debris within the valleys. There can be hanging valleys at an elevation on one or both sides of the main glacial valley. The faces of divides or spurs of such hanging valleys opening into main glacial valleys are quite often truncated to give them an appearance like triangular facets. Very deep glacial troughs filled with sea water and making up shorelines (in high latitudes) are called fjords/ fiords.\n\nWhat are the basic differences between glacial valleys and river valleys?\n\n## Depositional Landforms\n\nThe unassorted coarse and fine debris dropped by the melting glaciers is called glacial till. Most of the rock fragments in till are angular to sub-angular in form. Streams form by melting ice at the bottom, sides or lower ends of glaciers. Some amount of rock debris small enough to be carried by such meltwater streams is washed down and deposited. Such glacio-fluvial deposits are called outwash deposits. Unlike till deposits, the outwash deposits are roughly stratified and assorted. The rock fragments in outwash deposits are somewhat rounded at their edges. Figure 6.12 shows a few depositional landforms commonly found in glaciated areas.\n\n## Moraines\n\nThey are long ridges of deposits of glacial till. Terminal moraines are long ridges of debris",

Lateral moraines form along the sides parallel to the glacial valleys. The lateral moraines may join a terminal moraine forming a horse-shoe shaped ridge (Fig. 6.11). There can be many lateral moraines on either side in a glacial valley. These moraines partly or fully owe their origin to glacio-fluvial waters pushing up materials to the sides of glaciers. Many valley glaciers retreating rapidly leave an irregular sheet of till over their valley floors. Such deposits varying greatly in thickness and in surface topography are called ground moraines. The moraine in the centre of the glacial valley flanked by lateral moraines is called medial moraine. They are imperfectly formed as compared to lateral moraines. Sometimes medial moraines are indistinguishable from ground moraines.\n\n## Eskers\n\nWhen glaciers melt in summer, the water flows on the surface of the ice or seeps down along the margins or even moves through holes in the ice. These waters accumulate beneath the glacier and flow like streams in a channel beneath the ice. Such streams flow\nover the ground (not in a valley cut in the ground) with ice forming its banks. Very coarse materials like boulders and blocks along with some minor fractions of rock debris carried into this stream settle in the valley of ice beneath the glacier and after the ice melts can be found as a sinuous ridge called esker.\n\n## Outwash Plains\n\nThe plains at the foot of the glacial mountains or beyond the limits of continental ice sheets are covered with glacio-fluvial deposits in the form of broad flat alluvial fans which may join to form outwash plains of gravel, silt, sand and clay.\n\nDistinguish between river alluvial plains and glacial outwash plains.\n\n## Drumlins\n\nDrumlins are smooth oval shaped ridge-like features composed mainly of glacial till with some masses of gravel and sand.

The drumlins form due to dumping of rock debris beneath heavily loaded ice through fissures in the glacier. The stoss end gets blunted due to pushing by moving ice. Drumlins give an indication of direction of glacier movement.\n\nWhat is the difference between till and alluvium?\n\n## Waves and Currents\n\nCoastal processes are the most dynamic and hence most destructive. So, don't you think it is important to know about the coastal processes and forms?\n\nSome of the changes along the coasts take place very fast. At one place, there can be erosion in one season and deposition in another. Most of the changes along the coasts are accomplished by waves. When waves break, the water is thrown with great force onto the shore, and simultaneously, there is a great churning of sediments on the sea bottom. Constant impact of breaking waves drastically affects the coasts. Storm waves and tsunami waves can cause far-reaching changes in a short period of time than normal breaking waves. As wave environment changes, the intensity of the force of breaking waves changes.\n\nDo you know about the generating forces behind waves and currents? If not, refer to the chapter on movements in ocean waters.\n\nOther than the action of waves, the coastal landforms depend upon (i) the configuration of land and sea floor; (ii) whether the coast is advancing (emerging) seaward or retreating (submerging) landward. Assuming sea level to be constant, two types of coasts are considered to explain the concept of evolution of coastal landforms: (i) high, rocky coasts (submerged coasts); (ii) low, smooth\nand gently sloping sedimentary coasts (emerged coasts).\n\n## High Rocky Coasts\n\nAlong the high rocky coasts, the rivers appear to have been drowned with highly irregular coastline. The coastline appears highly indented with extension of water into the land where glacial valleys (fjords) are present. The hill sides drop off sharply into the water. Shores do not show any depositional landforms initially. Erosion features dominate.\n\nAlong high rocky coasts, waves break with great force against the land shaping the hill sides into cliffs. With constant pounding by waves, the cliffs recede leaving a wave-cut platform in front of the sea cliff. Waves gradually minimise the irregularities along the shore.\n\nThe materials which fall off, and removed from the sea cliffs, gradually break into smaller fragments and roll to roundness, will get deposited in the offshore. After a considerable period of cliff development and retreat when coastline turns somewhat smooth, with the addition of some more material to this deposit in the offshore, a wave-built terrace would develop in front of wave-cut terrace. As the erosion along the coast takes place a good supply material becomes available to longshore currents and waves to deposit them as beaches along the shore and as bars (long ridges of sand and/ or shingle parallel to the coast) in the nearshore zone. Bars are submerged features and when bars show up above water, they are called barrier bars. Barrier bar which get keyed up to the headland of a bay is called a spit. When barrier bars and spits form at the mouth of a bay and block it, a lagoon forms. The lagoons would gradually get filled up by sediments from the land giving rise to a coastal plain.\n\n## Low Sedimentary Coasts\n\nAlong low sedimentary coasts the rivers appear to extend their length by building coastal plains and deltas. The coastline appears smooth with occasional incursions",

      "content": "of water in the form of lagoons and tidal creeks. The land slopes gently into the water. Marshes and swamps may abound along the coasts. Depositional features dominate.\n\nWhen waves break over a gently sloping sedimentary coast, the bottom sediments get churned and move readily building bars, barrier bars, spits and lagoons. Lagoons would eventually turn into a swamp which would subsequently turn into a coastal plain. The maintenance of these depositional features depends upon the steady supply of materials. Storm and tsunami waves cause drastic changes irrespective of supply of sediments. Large rivers which bring lots of sediments build deltas along low sedimentary coasts.\n\nThe west coast of our country is a high rocky retreating coast. Erosional forms dominate in the west coast. The east coast of India is a low sedimentary coast. Depositional forms dominate in the east coast.\n\nWhat are the various differences between a high rocky coast and a low sedimentary coast in terms of processes and landforms?\n\n## EROSIONAL LANDFORMS\n\n## Cliffs, Terraces, Caves and Stacks\n\nWave-cut cliffs and terraces are two forms usually found where erosion is the dominant shore process. Almost all sea cliffs are steep and may range from a few m to 30 m or even more. At the foot of such cliffs there may be a flat or gently sloping platform covered by rock debris derived from the sea cliff behind. Such platforms occurring at elevations above the average height of waves is called a wavecut terrace. The lashing of waves against the base of the cliff and the rock debris that gets smashed against the cliff along with lashing waves create hollows and these hollows get widened and deepened to form sea caves. The roofs of caves collapse and the sea cliffs recede further inland. Retreat of the cliff may leave\nsome remnants of rock standing isolated as small islands just off the shore. Such resistant masses of rock, originally parts of a cliff or hill are called sea stacks. Like all other features, sea stacks are also temporary and eventually coastal hills and cliffs will disappear because of wave erosion giving rise to narrow coastal plains, and with onrush of deposits from over the land behind may get covered up by alluvium or may get covered up by shingle or sand to form a wide beach.\n\n## DEPOSITIONAL LANDFORMS\n\n## Beaches and Dunes\n\nBeaches are characteristic of shorelines that are dominated by deposition, but may occur as patches along even the rugged shores. Most of the sediment making up the beaches comes from land carried by the streams and rivers or from wave erosion. Beaches are temporary features. The sandy beach which appears so permanent may be reduced to a very narrow strip of coarse pebbles in some other season. Most of the beaches are made up of sand sized materials. Beaches called shingle beaches contain excessively small pebbles and even cobbles.\n\nJust behind the beach, the sands lifted and winnowed from over the beach surfaces will be deposited as sand dunes. Sand dunes forming long ridges parallel to the coastline are very common along low sedimentary coasts.\n\n## Bars, Barriers and Spits\n\nA ridge of sand and shingle formed in the sea in the off-shore zone lying approximately parallel to the coast is called an off-shore bar. An off-shore bar which is exposed due to further addition of sand is termed a barrier bar. The off-shore bars and barriers commonly form across the mouth of a river or at the entrance of a bay. Sometimes such barrier bars get keyed up to one end of the bay when they are called spits (Figure 6.13). Spits may also develop attached to headlands/hills. The barriers, bars and spits at the mouth of the bay gradually extend leaving only a small opening of the bay into the sea and the bay",

The lagoons get filled up gradually by sediment coming from the land or from the beach itself (aided by wind) and a broad and wide coastal plain may develop replacing a lagoon.\n\nDo you know, the coastal off-shore bars offer the first buffer or defence against storm or tsunami by absorbing most of their destructive force. Then come the barriers, beaches, beach dunes and mangroves, if any, to absorb the destructive force of storm and tsunami waves. So, if we do anything which disturbs the 'sediment budget' and the mangroves along the coast, these coastal forms will get eroded away leaving human habitations to bear first strike of storm and tsunami waves.\n\n## WINDS\n\nWind is one of the two dominant agents in hot deserts. The desert floors get heated up too much and too quickly because of being dry and barren. The heated floors heat up the air directly above them and result in upward movements in the hot lighter air with turbulence, and any obstructions in its path sets up eddies, whirlwinds, updrafts and downdrafts. Winds also move along the desert floors with great speed and the obstructions in their path create turbulence. Of course, there\nare storm winds which are very destructive. Winds cause deflation, abrasion and impact. Deflation includes lifting and removal of dust and smaller particles from the surface of rocks. In the transportation process sand and silt act as effective tools to abrade the land surface. The impact is simply sheer force of momentum which occurs when sand is blown into or against a rock surface. It is similar to sand-blasting operation. The wind action creates a number of interesting erosional and depositional features in the deserts.\n\nIn fact, many features of deserts owe their formation to mass wasting and running water as sheet floods. Though rain is scarce in deserts, it comes down torrentially in a short period of time. The desert rocks devoid of vegetation, exposed to mechanical and chemical weathering processes due to drastic diurnal temperature changes, decay faster and the torrential rains help in removing the weathered materials easily. That means, the weathered debris in deserts is moved by not only wind but also by rain/sheet wash. The wind moves fine materials and general mass erosion is accomplished mainly through sheet floods or sheet wash. Stream channels in desert areas are broad, smooth and indefinite and flow for a brief time after rains.\n\n## EROSIONAL LANDFORMS\n\n## Pediments and Pediplains\n\nLandscape evolution in deserts is primarily concerned with the formation and extension of pediments. Gently inclined rocky floors close to the mountains at their foot with or without a thin cover of debris, are called pediments. Such rocky floors form through the erosion of mountain front through a combination of lateral erosion by streams and sheet flooding.\n\nErosion starts along the steep margins of the landmass or the steep sides of the tectonically controlled steep incision features over the landmass. Once, pediments are formed with a steep wash slope followed by cliff or free face above it, the steep wash slope and free face retreat backwards. This method",

      "content": "of erosion is termed as parallel retreat of slopes through backwasting. So, through parallel retreat of slopes, the pediments extend backwards at the expense of mountain front, and gradually, the mountain gets reduced leaving an inselberg which is a remnant of the mountain. That's how the high relief in desert areas is reduced to low featureless plains called pediplains.\n\n## Playas\n\nPlains are by far the most prominent landforms in the deserts. In basins with mountains and hills around and along, the drainage is towards the centre of the basin and due to gradual deposition of sediment from basin margins, a nearly level plain forms at the centre of the basin. In times of sufficient water, this plain is covered up by a shallow water body. Such types of shallow lakes are called as playas where water is retained only for short duration due to evaporation and quite often the playas contain good deposition of salts. The playa plain covered up by salts is called alkali flats.\n\n## Deflation Hollows and Caves\n\nWeathered mantle from over the rocks or bare soil, gets blown out by persistent movement of wind currents in one direction. This process may create shallow depressions called deflation hollows. Deflation also creates numerous small pits or cavities over rock surfaces. The rock faces suffer impact and abrasion of wind-borne sand and first shallow depressions called blow outs are created, and some of the blow outs become deeper and wider fit to be called caves.\n\n## Mushroom, Table and Pedestal Rocks\n\nMany rock-outcrops in the deserts easily susceptible to wind deflation and abrasion are worn out quickly leaving some remnants of resistant rocks polished beautifully in the shape of mushroom with a slender stalk and a broad and rounded pear shaped cap above. Sometimes, the top surface is broad like a table top and quite often, the remnants stand out like pedestals.\n\nList the erosional features carved out by wind action and action of sheet floods.\n\n## Depositional Landforms\n\nWind is a good sorting agent. Depending upon the velocity of wind, different sizes of grains are moved along the floors by rolling or saltation and carried in suspension and in this process of transportation itself, the materials get sorted. When the wind slows or begins to die down, depending upon sizes of grains and their critical velocities, the grains will begin to settle. So, in depositional landforms made by wind, good sorting of grains can be found. Since wind is there everywhere and wherever there is good source of sand and with constant wind directions, depositional features in arid regions can develop anywhere.\n\n## Sand Dunes\n\nDry hot deserts are good places for sand dune formation. Obstacles to initiate dune formation are equally important. There can be a great variety of dune forms (Figure 6.14).\n\n\n**[IMAGE: Diagram showing different types of sand dunes: Barchan, Seif, Parabolic, Transverse, and Longitudinal.]**\n\n\n\nFigure 6.14 : Various types of sand dunes Arrows indicate wind direction",

      "content": "Crescent shaped dunes called barchans with the points or wings directed away from wind direction i.e., downwind, form where the wind direction is constant and moderate and where the original surface over which sand is moving is almost uniform. Parabolic dunes form when sandy surfaces are partially covered with vegetation. That means parabolic dunes are reversed barchans with wind direction being the same. Seifis similar to barchan with a small difference. Seif has only one wing or point. This happens when there is shift in wind conditions. The lone wings of seifs can grow very long and high. Longitudinal dunes\nform when supply of sand is poor and wind direction is constant. They appear as long ridges of considerable length but low in height. Transverse dunes are aligned perpendicular to wind direction. These dunes form when the wind direction is constant and the source of sand is an elongated feature at right angles to the wind direction. They may be very long and low in height. When sand is plenty, quite often, the regular shaped dunes coalesce and lose their individual characteristics. Most of the dunes in the deserts shift and a few of them will get stabilised especially near human habitations.\n\n# EXERCISES \n\n1.

We eat food two - three times a day and drink water more frequently but breathe every few seconds. Air is essential to the survival of all organisms. Some organisms like humans may survive for some time without food and water but can't survive even a few minutes without breathing air. That shows the reason why we should understand the atmosphere in greater detail. Atmosphere is a mixture of different gases and it envelopes the earth all round. It contains life-giving gases like oxygen for humans and animals and carbon dioxide for plants. The air is an integral part of the earth's mass and 99 per cent of the total mass of the atmosphere is confined to the height of 32 km from the earth's surface. The air is colourless and odourless and can be felt only when it blows as wind.\n\nCan you imagine what will happen to us in the absence of ozone in the atmosphere?\n\n## Composition of the Atmosphere\n\nThe atmosphere is composed of gases, water vapour and dust particles. The proportion of gases changes in the higher layers of the atmosphere in such a way that oxygen will be almost in negligible quantity at the height of 120 km . Similarly, carbon dioxide and water vapour are found only up to 90 km from the surface of the earth.\n\n## Gases\n\nCarbon dioxide is meteorologically a very important gas as it is transparent to the incoming solar radiation but opaque to the outgoing terrestrial radiation. It absorbs a part of terrestrial radiation and reflects back some part of it towards the earth's surface. It is largely responsible for the green house effect. The volume of other gases is constant but the volume of carbon dioxide has been rising in the past few decades mainly because of the burning of fossil fuels. This has also increased the temperature of the air. Ozone is another important component of the atmosphere found between 10 and 50 km above the earth's surface and acts as a filter and absorbs the ultra-violet rays radiating from the sun and prevents them from reaching the surface of the earth.\n\n## Water Vapour\n\nWater vapour is also a variable gas in the atmosphere, which decreases with altitude. In the warm and wet tropics, it may account for four per cent of the air by volume, while in the dry and cold areas of desert and polar regions, it may be less than one per cent of the air. Water vapour also decreases from the equator towards the poles. It also absorbs parts of the insolation from the sun and preserves the earth's radiated heat. It thus, acts like a blanket allowing the earth neither to become too cold nor too hot. Water vapour also contributes to the stability and instability in the air.",

Dust particles are generally concentrated in the lower layers of the atmosphere; yet, convectional air currents may transport them to great heights. The higher concentration of dust particles is found in subtropical and temperate regions due to dry winds in comparison to equatorial and polar regions. Dust and salt particles act as hygroscopic nuclei around which water vapour condenses to produce clouds.\n\n## Structure of the Atmosphere\n\nThe atmosphere consists of different layers with varying density and temperature. Density is highest near the surface of the earth and decreases with increasing altitude. The column of atmosphere is divided into five different layers depending upon the temperature condition. They are: troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, thermosphere and exosphere.\n\nThe troposphere is the lowermost layer of the atmosphere. Its average height is 13 km and extends roughly to a height of 8 km near the poles and about 18 km at the equator. Thickness of the troposphere is greatest at the equator because heat is transported to great heights by strong convectional currents. This layer contains dust particles and water vapour. All changes in climate and weather take place in this layer. The temperature in this layer decreases at the rate of 1 C for every 165 m of height. This is the most important layer for all biological activity.\n\nThe zone separating the tropsophere from stratosphere is known as the tropopause. The air temperature at the tropopause is about minus $80^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ over the equator and about minus $45^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ over the poles. The temperature here is nearly constant, and hence, it is called the\ntropopause. The stratosphere is found above the tropopause and extends up to a height of 50 km . One important feature of the stratosphere is that it contains the ozone layer. This layer absorbs ultra-violet radiation and shields life on the earth from intense, harmful form of energy.\n\nThe mesosphere lies above the stratosphere, which extends up to a height of 80 km . In this layer, once again, temperature starts decreasing with the increase in altitude and reaches up to minus 100 C at the height of 80 km . The upper limit of mesosphere is known as the mesopause. The ionosphere is located between 80 and 400 km above the mesopause. It contains electrically charged particles known as ions, and hence, it is known as ionosphere. Radio waves transmitted from the earth are reflected back to the earth by this layer. Temperature here starts increasing with height. The uppermost layer of the atmosphere above the thermosphere\n\n\n**[IMAGE: A diagram showing the different layers of the Earth's atmosphere and their temperature variations with altitude.]**\n\n\n\nFigure 7.1 : Structure of atmosphere",

Do you know that we live at the bottom of a huge pile of air? We inhale and exhale but we feel the air when it is in motion. It means air in motion is wind. You have already learnt about the fact that earth is surrounded by air all around. This envelop of air is atmosphere which is composed of numerous gases. These gases support life over the earth's surface.\n\nThe earth receives almost all of its energy from the sun. The earth in turn radiates back to space the energy received from the sun. As a result, the earth neither warms up nor does it get cooled over a period of time. Thus, the amount of heat received by different parts of the earth is not the same. This variation causes pressure differences in the atmosphere. This leads to transfer of heat from one region to the other by winds. This chapter explains the process of heating and cooling of the atmosphere and the resultant temperature distribution over the earth's surface.\n\n## Solar Radiation\n\nThe earth's surface receives most of its energy in short wavelengths. The energy received by the earth is known as incoming solar radiation which in short is termed as insolation.\n\nAs the earth is a geoid resembling a sphere, the sun's rays fall obliquely at the top of the atmosphere and the earth intercepts a very small portion of the sun's energy. On an average the earth receives 1.94 calories per sq. cm per minute at the top of its atmosphere.\n\nThe solar output received at the top of the atmosphere varies slightly in a year due to the variations in the distance between the earth and the sun. During its revolution around the sun, the earth is farthest from the sun ( 152 million km ) on 4th July. This position of the earth is called aphelion. On 3rd January, the earth is the nearest to the sun ( 147 million km ). This position is called perihelion. Therefore, the annual insolation received by the earth on 3rd January is slightly more than the amount received on 4th July. However, the effect of this variation in the solar output is masked by other factors like the distribution of land and sea and the atmospheric circulation. Hence, this variation in the solar output does not have great effect on daily weather changes on the surface of the earth.\n\n## Variability of Insolation at the Surface of the Earth\n\nThe amount and the intensity of insolation vary during a day, in a season and in a year. The factors that cause these variations in insolation are : (i) the rotation of earth on its axis; (ii) the angle of inclination of the sun's rays; (iii) the length of the day; (iv) the transparency of the atmosphere; (v) the configuration of land in terms of its aspect. The last two however, have less influence.\n\nThe fact that the earth's axis makes an angle of $661 / 2$ with the plane of its orbit round the sun has a greater influence on the amount of insolation received at different latitudes.\n\nThe second factor that determines the amount of insolation received is the angle of",

      "content": "inclination of the rays. This depends on the latitude of a place. The higher the latitude the less is the angle they make with the surface of the earth resulting in slant sun rays. The area covered by vertical rays is always less than the slant rays. If more area is covered, the energy gets distributed and the net energy received per unit area decreases. Moreover, the slant rays are required to pass through greater depth of the atmosphere resulting in more absorption, scattering and diffusion.\n\n\n**[IMAGE: Diagram showing the distribution of day and night on Earth due to its tilt and the position of the Sun.]**\n\n\n\nFigure 8.1 : Summer Solstice\n\n## The Passage of Solar Radiation through the Atmosphere\n\nThe atmosphere is largely transparent to short wave solar radiation. The incoming solar radiation passes through the atmosphere before striking the earth's surface. Within the troposphere water vapour, ozone and other gases absorb much of the near infrared radiation.\n\nVery small-suspended particles in the troposphere scatter visible spectrum both to the space and towards the earth surface. This process adds colour to the sky. The red colour of the rising and the setting sun and the blue colour of the sky are the result of scattering of light within the atmosphere.\n\n## Spatial Distribution of Insolation at the Earth's Surface\n\nThe insolation received at the surface varies from about $320 \\mathrm{Watt} / \\mathrm{m}^{2}$ in the tropics to about $70 \\mathrm{Watt} / \\mathrm{m}^{2}$ in the poles. Maximum\ninsolation is received over the subtropical deserts, where the cloudiness is the least. Equator receives comparatively less insolation than the tropics. Generally, at the same latitude the insolation is more over the continent than over the oceans. In winter, the middle and higher latitudes receive less radiation than in summer.\n\n## Heating and Cooling of Atmosphere\n\nThere are different ways of heating and cooling of the atmosphere.\n\nThe earth after being heated by insolation transmits the heat to the atmospheric layers near to the earth in long wave form. The air in contact with the land gets heated slowly and the upper layers in contact with the lower layers also get heated. This process is called conduction. Conduction takes place when two bodies of unequal temperature are in contact with one another, there is a flow of energy from the warmer to cooler body. The transfer of heat continues until both the bodies attain the same temperature or the contact is broken. Conduction is important in heating the lower layers of the atmosphere.\n\nThe air in contact with the earth rises vertically on heating in the form of currents and further transmits the heat of the atmsphere. This process of vertical heating of the atmosphere is known as convection. The convective transfer of energy is confined only to the troposphere.\n\nThe transfer of heat through horizontal movement of air is called advection. Horizontal movement of the air is relatively more important than the vertical movement. In middle latitudes, most of dirunal (day and night) variation in daily weather are caused by advection alone. In tropical regions particularly in northern India during summer season local winds called 'loo' is the outcome of advection process.\n\n## Terrestrial Radiation\n\nThe insolation received by the earth is in short waves forms and heats up its surface.

      "content": "earth after being heated itself becomes a radiating body and it radiates energy to the atmosphere in long wave form. This energy heats up the atmosphere from below. This process is known as terrestrial radiation.\n\nThe long wave radiation is absorbed by the atmospheric gases particularly by carbon dioxide and the other green house gases. Thus, the atmosphere is indirectly heated by the earth's radiation.\n\nThe atmosphere in turn radiates and transmits heat to the space. Finally the amount of heat received from the sun is returned to space, thereby maintaining constant temperature at the earth's surface and in the atmosphere.\n\n## Heat Budget of the Planet Earth\n\nFigure 9.2 depicts the heat budget of the planet earth. The earth as a whole does not accumulate or loose heat. It maintains its temperature. This can happen only if the amount of heat received in the form of insolation equals the amount lost by the earth through terrestrial radiation.\n\nConsider that the insolation received at the top of the atmosphere is 100 per cent. While passing through the atmosphere some amount of energy is reflected, scattered and absorbed. Only the remaining part reaches\n\n\n**[IMAGE: Diagram illustrating the distribution and absorption of solar radiation on Earth.]**\n\n\nthe earth surface. Roughly 35 units are reflected back to space even before reaching the earth's surface. Of these, 27 units are reflected back from the top of the clouds and 2 units from the snow and ice-covered areas of the earth. The reflected amount of radiation is called the albedo of the earth.\n\nThe remaining 65 units are absorbed, 14 units within the atmosphere and 51 units by the earth's surface. The earth radiates back 51 units in the form of terrestrial radiation. Of these, 17 units are radiated to space directly and the remaining 34 units are absorbed by the atmosphere ( 6 units absorbed directly by the atmosphere, 9 units through convection and turbulence and 19 units through latent heat of condensation). 48 units absorbed by the atmosphere ( 14 units from insolation +34 units from terrestrial radiation) are also radiated back into space. Thus, the total radiation returning from the earth and the atmosphere respectively is $17+48=65$ units which balance the total of 65 units received from the sun. This is termed the heat budget or heat balance of the earth.\n\nThis explains, why the earth neither warms up nor cools down despite the huge transfer of heat that takes place.\n\n\n**[IMAGE: A diagram illustrating the long wave earth radiation, showing the flow of radiation from the earth and atmosphere to space and the processes involved.]**\n\n\n\nFigure 8.2 : Heat budget of the earth",

      "content": "## Variation in the Net Heat Budget at the Earth's Surface\n\nAs explained earlier, there are variations in the amount of radiation received at the earth's surface. Some part of the earth has surplus radiation balance while the other part has deficit.\n\nFigure 8.3 depicts the latitudinal variation in the net radiation balance of the earth the atmosphere system. The figure shows that there is a surplus of net radiation balance between 40 degrees north and south and the regions near the poles have a deficit. The surplus heat energy from the tropics is redistributed pole wards and as a result the tropics do not get progressively heated up due to the accumulation of excess heat or the high latitudes get permanently frozen due to excess deficit.\n\n\n**[IMAGE: A chart showing the relationship between solar radiation, terrestrial radiation, and latitude.]**\n\n\n\nFigure 8.3 : Latitudinal variation in net radiation balance\n\n## Temperature\n\nThe interaction of insolation with the atmosphere and the earth's surface creates heat which is measured in terms of temperature. While heat represents the molecular movement of particles comprising a substance, the temperature is the measurement in degrees of how hot (or cold) a thing (or a place) is.\n\n## Factors Controlling Temperature Distribution\n\nThe temperature of air at any place is influenced by (i) the latitude of the place; (ii) the altitude of the place; (iii) distance from\nthe sea, the air-mass circulation; (iv) the presence of warm and cold ocean currents; (v) local aspects.\n\nThe latitude : The temperature of a place depends on the insolation received. It has been explained earlier that the insolation varies according to the latitude hence the temperature also varies accordingly.\n\nThe altitude : The atmosphere is indirectly heated by terrestrial radiation from below. Therefore, the places near the sea-level record higher temperature than the places situated at higher elevations. In other words, the temperature generally decreases with increasing height. The rate of decrease of temperature with height is termed as the normal lapse rate. It is 6.5 C per $1,000 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nDistance from the sea : Another factor that influences the temperature is the location of a place with respect to the sea. Compared to land, the sea gets heated slowly and loses heat slowly. Land heats up and cools down quickly. Therefore, the variation in temperature over the sea is less compared to land. The places situated near the sea come under the moderating influence of the sea and land breezes which moderate the temperature.\n\nAir-mass and Ocean currents : Like the land and sea breezes, the passage of air masses also affects the temperature. The places, which come under the influence of warm airmasses experience higher temperature and the places that come under the influence of cold air-masses experience low temperature. Similarly, the places located on the coast where the warm ocean currents flow record higher temperature than the places located on the coast where the cold currents flow.\n\n## Distribution of Temperature\n\nThe global distribution of temperature can well be understood by studying the temperature distribution in January and July. The temperature distribution is generally",

Figure 8.4 (a) and (b) show the distribution of surface air temperature in the month of January and July.\n\nIn general the effect of the latitude on temperature is well pronounced on the map, as the isotherms are generally parallel to the latitude. The deviation from this general trend is more pronounced in January than in July, especially in the northern hemisphere. In the northern hemisphere the land surface area is much larger than in the southern hemisphere. Hence, the effects of land mass and the ocean currents are well pronounced. In January the isotherms deviate to the north over the ocean and to the south over the continent. This can be seen on the North Atlantic Ocean. The presence of warm ocean currents, Gulf Stream and North Atlantic drift, make the Northern Atlantic Ocean warmer and the isotherms\nbend towards the north. Over the land the temperature decreases sharply and the isotherms bend towards south in Europe.\n\nIt is much pronounced in the Siberian plain. The mean January temperature along 60 E longitude is minus 20 C both at 80 N and 50 N latitudes. The mean monthly temperature for January is over 27 C , in equatorial oceans over 24 C in the tropics and $2 \\mathrm{C}-0 \\mathrm{C}$ in the middle latitudes and -18 C to -48 C in the Eurasian continental interior.\n\nThe effect of the ocean is well pronounced in the southern hemisphere. Here the isotherms are more or less parallel to the latitudes and the variation in temperature is more gradual than in the northern hemisphere. The isotherm of $20^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}, 10 \\mathrm{C}$, and 0 C runs parallel to 35 S, 45 S and 60 S latitudes respectively.\n\nIn July the isotherms generally run parallel to the latitude.

Along the 40 N runs the isotherm of 10 C and along the 40 S the temperature is 10 C .\n\nFigure 8.5 shows the range of temperature between January and July. The highest range of temperature is more than 60 C over the north-eastern part of Eurasian continent. This is due to continentality. The least range of temperature, 3 C , is found between 20 S and 15 N .\n\n## Inversion of Temperature\n\nNormally, temperature decreases with increase in elevation. It is called normal lapse rate. At times, the situations is reversed and the normal lapse rate is inverted. It is called Inversion of temperature. Inversion is usually of short duration but quite common nonetheless. A long winter night with clear skies and still air is ideal situation for inversion. The heat of the day is radiated off during the night, and by early morning hours, the earth is cooler than the air above. Over polar areas, temperature inversion is normal throughout the year.\n\nSurface inversion promotes stability in the lower layers of the atmosphere. Smoke and dust particles get collected beneath the inversion layer and spread horizontally to fill the lower strata of the atmosphere. Dense fogs in mornings are common occurrences especially during winter season. This inversion commonly lasts for few hours until the sun comes up and beings to warm the earth.\n\nThe inversion takes place in hills and mountains due to air drainage. Cold air at the hills and mountains, produced during night, flows under the influence of gravity. Being heavy and dense, the cold air acts almost like water and moves down the slope to pile up deeply in pockets and valley bottoms with warm air above. This is called air drainage.

Air expands when heated and gets compressed when cooled. This results in variations in the atmospheric pressure. The result is that it causes the movement of air from high pressure to low pressure, setting the air in motion. You already know that air in horizontal motion is wind. Atmospheric pressure also determines when the air will rise or sink. The wind redistributes the heat and moisture across the planet, thereby, maintaining a constant temperature for the planet as a whole. The vertical rising of moist air cools it down to form the clouds and bring precipitation. This chapter has been devoted to explain the causes of pressure differences, the forces that control the atmospheric circulation, the turbulent pattern of wind, the formation of air masses, the disturbed weather when air masses interact with each other and the phenomenon of violent tropical storms.\n\n## Atmospheric Pressure\n\nDo you realise that our body is subjected to a lot of air pressure. As one moves up the air gets varified and one feels breathless.\n\nThe weight of a column of air contained in a unit area from the mean sea level to the top of the atmosphere is called the atmospheric pressure. The atmospheric pressure is expressed in units of milibar. At sea level the average atmospheric pressure is 1,013.2 milibar. Due to gravity the air at the surface is denser and hence has higher pressure. Air\npressure is measured with the help of a mercury barometer or the aneroid barometer. Consult your book, Practical Work in Geography - Part I(NCERT, 2006) and learn about these instruments. The pressure decreases with height. At any elevation it varies from place to place and its variation is the primary cause of air motion, i.e. wind which moves from high pressure areas to low pressure areas.\n\n## Vertical Variation of Pressure\n\nIn the lower atmosphere the pressure decreases rapidly with height. The decrease amounts to about 1 mb for each 10 m increase in elevation. It does not always decrease at the same rate. Table 9.1 gives the average pressure and temperature at selected levels of elevation for a standard atmosphere.\n\nTable 9.1 : Standard Pressure and Temperature at Selected Levels\n\n| Level | Pressure in mb | Temperature $C$ |\n| :-- | :--: | :--: |\n| Sea Level | 1,013.25 | 15.2 |\n| 1 km | 898.76 | 8.7 |\n| 5 km | 540.48 | -17.3 |\n| 10 km | 265.00 | -49.7 |\n\nThe vertical pressure gradient force is much larger than that of the horizontal pressure gradient. But, it is generally balanced by a nearly equal but opposite gravitational force. Hence, we do not experience strong upward winds.",

Horizontal distribution of pressure is studied by drawing isobars at constant levels. Isobars are lines connecting places having equal pressure. In order to eliminate the effect of altitude on pressure, it is measured at any station after being reduced to sea level for\npurposes of comparison. The sea level pressure distribution is shown on weather maps.\n\nFigure 9.1 shows the patterns of isobars corresponding to pressure systems. Lowpressure system is enclosed by one or more isobars with the lowest pressure in the centre. High-pressure system is also enclosed by one or more isobars with the highest pressure in the centre.\n\n## World Distribution of Sea Level Pressure\n\nThe world distribution of sea level pressure in January and July has been shown in Figures 9.2 and 9.3. Near the equator the sea level pressure is low and the area is known as equatorial low. Along $30 \\mathrm{~N}^{-1}$ and $30^{\\circ} \\mathrm{S}$ are found the high-pressure areas known as the subtropical highs. Further pole wards along $60^{\\circ} \\mathrm{N}$ and $60^{\\circ} \\mathrm{S}$, the low-pressure belts are termed as the sub polar lows. Near the poles the pressure is high and it is known as the polar high. These pressure belts are not permanent\n\n\n**[IMAGE: A diagram showing global atmospheric pressure belts and wind patterns, including the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ).]**\n\n\n\nFigure 9.2 : Distribution of pressure (in millibars) - January",

They oscillate with the apparent movement of the sun. In the northern hemisphere in winter they move southwards and in the summer northwards.\n\n## Forces Affecting the Velocity and Direction of Wind\n\nYou already know that the air is set in motion due to the differences in atmospheric pressure. The air in motion is called wind. The wind blows from high pressure to low pressure. The wind at the surface experiences friction. In addition, rotation of the earth also affects the wind movement. The force exerted by the rotation of the earth is known as the Coriolis force. Thus, the horizontal winds near the earth surface respond to the combined effect of three forces - the pressure gradient force, the frictional force and the Coriolis force. In addition, the gravitational force acts downward.\n\n## Pressure Gradient Force\n\nThe differences in atmospheric pressure produces a force. The rate of change of pressure with respect to distance is the pressure gradient. The pressure gradient is strong where the isobars are close to each other and is weak where the isobars are apart.\n\n## Frictional Force\n\nIt affects the speed of the wind. It is greatest at the surface and its influence generally extends upto an elevation of $1-3 \\mathrm{~km}$. Over the sea surface the friction is minimal.\n\n## Coriolis Force\n\nThe rotation of the earth about its axis affects the direction of the wind. This force is called the Coriolis force after the French physicist who described it in 1844. It deflects the wind to the right direction in the northern hemisphere and",

It is maximum at the poles and is absent at the equator.\n\nThe Coriolis force acts perpendicular to the pressure gradient force. The pressure gradient force is perpendicular to an isobar. The higher the pressure gradient force, the more is the velocity of the wind and the larger is the deflection in the direction of wind. As a result of these two forces operating perpendicular to each other, in the low-pressure areas the wind blows around it. At the equator, the Coriolis force is zero and the wind blows perpendicular to the isobars. The low pressure gets filled instead of getting intensified. That is the reason why tropical cyclones are not formed near the equator.\n\n## Pressure and Wind\n\nThe velocity and direction of the wind are the net result of the wind generating forces. The winds in the upper atmosphere, $2-3 \\mathrm{~km}$ above the surface, are free from frictional effect of the surface and are controlled mainly by the pressure gradient and the Coriolis force. When isobars are straight and when there is no friction, the pressure gradient force is balanced by the Coriolis force and the resultant wind blows parallel to the isobar. This wind is known as the geostrophic wind (Figure 9.4).\n\n\n**[IMAGE: Diagram illustrating the balance between the Coriolis force, geostrophic wind, and horizontal pressure gradient in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.]**\n\n\n\nFigure 9.4 : Geostropic Wind\n\nThe wind circulation around a low is called cyclonic circulation. Around a high it is called anti cyclonic circulation. The direction of winds around such systems changes according to their location in different hemispheres (Table 9.2).\n\nThe wind circulation at the earth's surface around low and high on many occasions is closely related to the wind circulation at higher level. Generally, over low pressure area the air will converge and rise. Over high pressure area the air will subside from above and diverge at the surface (Figure 9.5). Apart from convergence, some eddies, convection currents, orographic uplift and uplift along fronts cause the rising of air, which is essential for the formation of clouds and precipitation.\n\n\n**[IMAGE: Diagram illustrating the convergence and divergence of ocean currents at the surface and at depth.]**\n\n\n\nFigure 9.5 : Convergence and divergence of winds\n\n## General circulation of the atmosphere\n\nThe pattern of planetary winds largely depends on : (i) latitudinal variation of atmospheric heating; (ii) emergence of pressure belts; (iii) the migration of belts following apparent path of the sun; (iv) the distribution of continents and oceans; (v) the rotation of earth. The pattern of the movement of the planetary winds is called the general circulation of the atmosphere.

A schematic description of the general circulation is shown in Figure 9.6.\n\n\n**[IMAGE: Diagram illustrating global atmospheric circulation patterns, including trade winds, westerlies, and polar easterlies.]**\n\n\n\nFigure 9. 6 : Simplified general circulation of the atmosphere\n\nThe air at the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) rises because of convection caused by high insolation and a low pressure is created. The winds from the tropics converge at this low pressure zone. The converged air rises along with the convective cell. It reaches the top of the troposphere up to an altitude of 14 km . and moves towards the poles. This causes accumulation of air at about $30^{\\circ} \\mathrm{N}$ and S. Part of the accumulated air sinks to the ground and forms a subtropical high. Another reason for sinking is the cooling of air when it reaches $30^{\\circ} \\mathrm{N}$ and S latitudes. Down below near the land surface the air flows towards the equator as the easterlies. The easterlies from either side of the equator converge in the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). Such circulations from the surface upwards and vice-versa are called cells. Such a cell in the tropics is called Hadley Cell. In the middle latitudes the circulation is that of sinking cold air that comes from the poles and the rising warm air that blows from the subtropical high. At the surface these winds are called westerlies and the cell is known as the Ferrel cell. At polar latitudes the cold dense air subsides near the poles and blows towards middle latitudes as the polar easterlies. This cell is called the polar cell. These three cells set the pattern for the general circulation of the atmosphere. The transfer of heat energy from lower latitudes to higher latitudes maintains the general circulation.\n\nThe general circulation of the atmosphere also affects the oceans. The large-scale winds of the atmosphere initiate large and slow moving currents of the ocean. Oceans in turn provide input of energy and water vapour into the air. These interactions take place rather slowly over a large part of the ocean.\n\n## General Atmospheric Circulation and its Effects on Oceans\n\nWarming and cooling of the Pacific Ocean is most important in terms of general atmospheric circulation. The warm water of the central Pacific Ocean slowly drifts towards South American coast and replaces the cool Peruvian current. Such appearance of warm water off the coast of Peru is known as the El Nino. The El Nino event is closely associated with the pressure changes in the Central Pacific and Australia. This change in pressure condition over Pacific is known as the southern oscillation. The combined phenomenon of southern oscillation and El Nino is known as ENSO. In the years when the ENSO is strong, large-scale variations in weather occur over the world. The arid west coast of South America receives heavy rainfall, drought occurs in Australia and sometimes in India and floods in China. This phenomenon is closely monitored and is used for long range forecasting in major parts of the world.\n\n## Seasonal Wind\n\nThe pattern of wind circulation is modified in different seasons due to the shifting of regions of maximum heating, pressure and wind belts. The most pronounced effect of such a shift is noticed in the monsoons, especially over southeast Asia. You would be studying the details of monsoon in the book India : Physical Environment (NCERT, 2006). The other local deviations from the general circulation system are as follows.\n\n## Local Winds\n\nDifferences in the heating and cooling of earth surfaces and the cycles those develop daily or annually can create several common, local or regional winds.",

      "content": "## Land and Sea Breezes\n\nAs explained earlier, the land and sea absorb and transfer heat differently. During the day the land heats up faster and becomes warmer than the sea. Therefore, over the land the air rises giving rise to a low pressure area, whereas the sea is relatively cool and the pressure over sea is relatively high. Thus, pressure gradient from sea to land is created and the wind blows from the sea to the land as the sea breeze. In the night the reversal of condition takes place. The land loses heat faster and is cooler than the sea. The pressure gradient is from the land to the sea and hence land breeze results (Figure 9.7).\n\n\n**[IMAGE: Diagram illustrating sea breeze and land breeze phenomena.]**\n\n\n\nFigure 9.7 : Land and sea breezes\n\n## Mountain and Valley Winds\n\nIn mountainous regions, during the day the slopes get heated up and air moves upslope and to fill the resulting gap the air from the valley blows up the valley. This wind is known\nas the valley breeze. During the night the slopes get cooled and the dense air descends into the valley as the mountain wind. The cool air, of the high plateaus and ice fields draining into the valley is called katabatic wind. Another type of warm wind occurs on the leeward side of the mountain ranges. The moisture in these winds, while crossing the mountain ranges condense and precipitate. When it descends down the leeward side of the slope the dry air gets warmed up by adiabatic process. This dry air may melt the snow in a short time.\n\n## Air Masses\n\nWhen the air remains over a homogenous area for a sufficiently longer time, it acquires the characteristics of the area. The homogenous regions can be the vast ocean surface or vast plains. The air with distinctive characteristics in terms of temperature and humidity is called an airmass. It is defined as a large body of air having little horizontal variation in temperature and moisture. The homogenous surfaces, over which air masses form, are called the source regions.\n\nThe air masses are classified according to the source regions. There are five major source regions. These are: (i) Warm tropical and subtropical oceans; (ii) The subtropical hot deserts; (iii) The relatively cold high latitude oceans; (iv) The very cold snow covered continents in high latitudes; (v) Permanently ice covered continents in the Arctic and Antarctica. Accordingly, following types of airmasses are recognised: (i) Maritime tropical (mT); (ii) Continental tropical (cT); (iii) Maritime polar (mP); (iv) Continental polar (cP); (v) Continental arctic (cA). Tropical air masses are warm and polar air masses are cold.\n\n## Fronts\n\nWhen two different air masses meet, the boundary zone between them is called a front. The process of formation of the fronts is known as frontogenesis. There are four types of fronts: (a) Cold; (b) Warm; (c) Stationary; (d) Occluded. When the front remains stationary, it is called a stationary front. When the cold air moves",

If an air mass is fully lifted above the land surface, it is called the occluded front. The fronts occur in middle latitudes and are characterised by steep gradient in temperature and pressure. They bring abrupt changes in temperature and cause the air to rise to form clouds and cause precipitation.\n\n## Extra Tropical Cyclones\n\nThe systems developing in the mid and high latitude, beyond the tropics are called the middle latitude or extra tropical cyclones. The passage of front causes abrupt changes in the weather conditions over the area in the middle and high latitudes.\n\nExtra tropical cyclones form along the polar front. Initially, the front is stationary. In the northern hemisphere, warm air blows from the south and cold air from the north of the front. When the pressure drops along the front, the warm air moves northwards and the cold air move towards, south setting in motion an\nanticlockwise cyclonic circulation. The cyclonic circulation leads to a well developed extra tropical cyclone, with a warm front and a cold front. The plan and cross section of a well developed cyclone is given in Figure 9.9. There are pockets of warm air or warm sector wedged between the forward and the rear cold air or cold sector. The warm air glides over the cold air and a sequence of clouds appear over the sky ahead of the warm front and cause precipitation. The cold front approaches the warm air from behind and pushes the warm air up. As a result, cumulus clouds develop along the cold front. The cold front moves faster than the warm front ultimately overtaking the warm front. The warm air is completely lifted up and the front is occluded and the cyclone dissipates.\n\nThe processes of wind circulation both at the surface and aloft are closely interlinked. The extra tropical cyclone differs from the tropical cyclone in number of ways. The extra tropical cyclones have a clear frontal system\n\n\n**[IMAGE: Diagram illustrating the formation and structure of a cyclone, showing the interaction between warm and cold air.]**\n\n\n\nFigure 9. 9 : Extra tropical cyclones",

Whereas the tropical cyclones originate only over the seas and on reaching the land they dissipate. The extra tropical cyclone affects a much larger area as compared to the tropical cyclone. The wind velocity in a tropical cyclone is much higher and it is more destructive. The extra tropical cyclones move from west to east but tropical cyclones, move from east to west.\n\n## Tropical Cyclones\n\nTropical cyclones are violent storms that originate over oceans in tropical areas and move over to the coastal areas bringing about large scale destruction caused by violent winds, very heavy rainfall and storm surges. This is one of the most devastating natural calamities. They are known as Cyclones in the Indian Ocean, Hurricanes in the Atlantic, Typhoons in the Western Pacific and South China Sea, and Willy-willies in the Western Australia.\n\nTropical cyclones originate and intensify over warm tropical oceans. The conditions favourable for the formation and intensification of tropical storms are: (i) Large sea surface with temperature higher than $27^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$; (ii) Presence of the Coriolis force; (iii) Small variations in the vertical wind speed; (iv) A pre-existing weak-low-pressure area or low-level-cyclonic circulation; (v) Upper divergence above the sea level system.\n\nThe energy that intensifies the storm, comes from the condensation process in the towering cumulonimbus clouds, surrounding the centre of the storm. With continuous supply of moisture from the sea, the storm is further strengthened. On reaching the land the moisture supply is cut off and the storm dissipates. The place where a tropical cyclone crosses the coast is called the landfall of the cyclone. The cyclones, which cross $20^{\\circ} \\mathrm{N}$ latitude generally, recurve and they are more destructive.\n\nA schematic representation of the vertical structure of a mature tropical cyclonic storm is shown in Figure 9.10.\n\nA mature tropical cyclone is characterised by the strong spirally circulating wind around the centre, called the eye. The diameter of the circulating system can vary between 150 and 250 km .\n\nThe eye is a region of calm with subsiding air. Around the eye is the eye wall, where there is a strong spiralling ascent of air to greater height reaching the tropopause. The wind reaches maximum velocity in this region, reaching as high as 250 km per hour. Torrential rain occurs here. From the eye wall rain bands may radiate and trains of cumulus and cumulonimbus clouds may drift into the outer region. The diameter of the storm over the Bay of Bengal, Arabian sea and Indian ocean is between $600-1200 \\mathrm{~km}$. The system moves slowly about $300-500 \\mathrm{~km}$ per day. The cyclone creates storm surges and they inundate the coastal low lands. The storm peters out on the land.\n\n\n**[IMAGE: A diagram illustrating the structure and dynamics of a tropical cyclone, including the eye, eye wall, rain bands, and outflow.]**\n\n\n\nFigure 9.10: Vertical section of the tropical cyclone (after Rama Sastry)",

      "content": "## Thunderstorms and Tornadoes\n\nOther severe local storms are thunderstorms and tornadoes. They are of short duration, occurring over a small area but are violent. Thunderstorms are caused by intense convection on moist hot days. A thunderstorm is a well-grown cumulonimbus cloud producing thunder and lightening. When the clouds extend to heights where sub-zero temperature prevails, hails are formed and they come down as hailstorm. If there is insufficient moisture, a thunderstorm can generate duststorms. A thunderstorm is characterised by intense updraft of rising warm air, which causes the clouds to grow bigger and rise to\ngreater height. This causes precipitation. Later, downdraft brings down to earth the cool air and the rain. From severe thunderstorms sometimes spiralling wind descends like a trunk of an elephant with great force, with very low pressure at the centre, causing massive destruction on its way. Such a phenomenon is called a tornado. Tornadoes generally occur in middle latitudes. The tornado over the sea is called water spouts.\n\nThese violent storms are the manifestation of the atmosphere's adjustments to varying energy distribution. The potential and heat energies are converted into kinetic energy in these storms and the restless atmosphere again returns to its stable state.\n\n# EXERCISES \n\n1.

It varies from zero to four per cent by volume of the atmosphere and plays an important role in the weather phenomena. Water is present in the atmosphere in three forms namely - gaseous, liquid and solid. The moisture in the atmosphere is derived from water bodies through evaporation and from plants through transpiration. Thus, there is a continuous exchange of water between the atmosphere, the oceans and the continents through the processes of evaporation, transpiration, condensation and precipitation.\n\nWater vapour present in the air is known as humidity. It is expressed quantitatively in different ways. The actual amount of the water vapour present in the atmosphere is known as the absolute humidity. It is the weight of water vapour per unit volume of air and is expressed in terms of grams per cubic metre. The ability of the air to hold water vapour depends entirely on its temperature. The absolute humidity differs from place to place on the surface of the earth. The percentage of moisture present in the atmosphere as compared to its full capacity at a given temperature is known as the relative humidity. With the change of air temperature, the capacity to retain moisture increases or decreases and the relative humidity is also affected. It is greater over the oceans and least over the continents.\n\nThe air containing moisture to its full capacity at a given temperature is said to be saturated. It means that the air at the given temperature is incapable of holding any additional amount of moisture at that stage. The temperature at which saturation occurs in a given sample of air is known as dew point.\n\n## Evaporation and Condensation\n\nThe amount of water vapour in the atmosphere is added or withdrawn due to evaporation and condensation respectively. Evaporation is a process by which water is transformed from liquid to gaseous state. Heat is the main cause for evaporation. The temperature at which the water starts evaporating is referred to as the latent heat of vapourisation.\n\nIncrease in temperature increases water absorption and retention capacity of the given parcel of air. Similarly, if the moisture content is low, air has a potentiality of absorbing and retaining moisture. Movement of air replaces the saturated layer with the unsaturated layer. Hence, the greater the movement of air, the greater is the evaporation.\n\nThe transformation of water vapour into water is called condensation. Condensation is caused by the loss of heat. When moist air is cooled, it may reach a level when its capacity to hold water vapour ceases. Then, the excess water vapour condenses into liquid form. In free air, condensation results from cooling around very small particles termed as hygroscopic condensation nuclei. Particles of dust, smoke and salt from the ocean are particularly good nuclei because they absorb water. Condensation also takes place when the moist air comes in contact with some colder object and it may also take place when the temperature is close to the dew point. Condensation, therefore, depends upon the amount of cooling and the relative humidity of the air. Condensation is influenced by the volume of air, temperature, pressure and humidity. Condensation takes place: (i) when",

      "content": "the temperature of the air is reduced to dew point with its volume remaining constant; (ii) when both the volume and the temperature are reduced; (iv) when moisture is added to the air through evaporation. However, the most favourable condition for condensation is the decrease in air temperature.\n\nAfter condensation the water vapour or the moisture in the atmosphere takes one of the following forms - dew, frost, fog and clouds. Forms of condensation can be classified on the basis of temperature and location. Condensation takes place when the dew point is lower than the freezing point as well as higher than the freezing point.\n\n## Dew\n\nWhen the moisture is deposited in the form of water droplets on cooler surfaces of solid objects (rather than nuclei in air above the surface) such as stones, grass blades and plant leaves, it is known as dew. The ideal conditions for its formation are clear sky, calm air, high relative humidity, and cold and long nights. For the formation of dew, it is necessary that the dew point is above the freezing point.\n\n## Frost\n\nFrost forms on cold surfaces when condensation takes place below freezing point $\\left(0^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}\\right)$, i.e. the dew point is at or below the freezing point. The excess moisture is deposited in the form of minute ice crystals instead of water droplets. The ideal conditions for the formation of white frost are the same as those for the formation of dew, except that the air temperature must be at or below the freezing point.\n\n## Fog and Mist\n\nWhen the temperature of an air mass containing a large quantity of water vapour falls all of a sudden, condensation takes place within itself on fine dust particles. So, the fog is a cloud with its base at or very near to the ground. Because of the fog and mist, the visibility becomes poor to zero. In urban and industrial centres smoke provides plenty of nuclei which help the formation of fog and mist. Such a\ncondition when fog is mixed with smoke, is described as smog. The only difference between the mist and fog is that mist contains more moisture than the fog. In mist each nuceli contains a thicker layer of moisture. Mists are frequent over mountains as the rising warm air up the slopes meets a cold surface. Fogs are drier than mist and they are prevalent where warm currents of air come in contact with cold currents. Fogs are mini clouds in which condensation takes place around nuclei provided by the dust, smoke, and the salt particles.\n\n## Clouds\n\nCloud is a mass of minute water droplets or tiny crystals of ice formed by the condensation of the water vapour in free air at considerable elevations. As the clouds are formed at some height over the surface of the earth, they take various shapes. According to their height, expanse, density and transparency or opaqueness clouds are grouped under four types : (i) cirrus; (ii) cumulus; (iii) stratus; (iv) nimbus.\n\n## Cirrus\n\nCirrus clouds are formed at high altitudes (8,000 - 12,000m). They are thin and detatched clouds having a feathery appearance. They are always white in colour.\n\n## Cumulus\n\nCumulus clouds look like cotton wool. They are generally formed at a height of 4,000 $7,000 \\mathrm{~m}$. They exist in patches and can be seen scattered here and there. They have a flat base.\n\n## Stratus\n\nAs their name implies, these are layered clouds covering large portions of the sky. These clouds are generally formed either due to loss of heat or the mixing of air masses with different temperatures.\n\n## Nimbus\n\nNimbus clouds are black or dark gray. They form at middle levels or very near to the surface",

When the resistance of the air fails to hold them against the force of gravity, they fall on to the earth's surface. So after the condensation of water vapour, the release of moisture is known as precipitation. This may take place in liquid or solid form. The precipitation in the form of water is called rainfall, when the temperature is lower than the $0^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$, precipitation takes place in the form of fine flakes of snow and is called snowfall. Moisture is released in the form of hexagonal crystals. These crystals form flakes of snow. Besides rain and snow, other forms of precipitation are sleet and hail, though the latter are limited in occurrence and are sporadic in both time and space.\n\nSleet is frozen raindrops and refrozen melted snow-water. When a layer of air with the temperature above freezing point overlies a subfreezing layer near the ground, precipitation takes place in the form of sleet. Raindrops, which leave the warmer air, encounter the colder air below. As a result, they solidify and reach the ground as small pellets of ice not bigger than the raindrops from which they are formed.\n\nSometimes, drops of rain after being released by the clouds become solidified into small rounded solid pieces of ice and which reach the surface of the earth are called hailstones. These are formed by the rainwater passing through the colder layers. Hailstones have several concentric layers of ice one over the other.\n\n## Types of Rainfall\n\nOn the basis of origin, rainfall may be classified into three main types - the convectional, orographic or relief and the cyclonic or frontal.\n\n## Convectional Rain\n\nThe, air on being heated, becomes light and rises up in convection currents. As it rises, it expands and loses heat and consequently, condensation takes place and cumulous clouds are formed. With thunder and lightening, heavy rainfall takes place but this does not last",

      "content": "long. Such rain is common in the summer or in the hotter part of the day. It is very common in the equatorial regions and interior parts of the continents, particularly in the northern hemisphere.\n\n## Orographic Rain\n\nWhen the saturated air mass comes across a mountain, it is forced to ascend and as it rises, it expands; the temperature falls, and the moisture is condensed. The chief characteristic of this sort of rain is that the windward slopes receive greater rainfall. After giving rain on the windward side, when these winds reach the other slope, they descend, and their temperature rises. Then their capacity to take in moisture increases and hence, these leeward slopes remain rainless and dry. The area situated on the leeward side, which gets less rainfall is known as the rain-shadow area. It is also known as the relief rain.\n\n## Cyclonic Rain\n\nYou have already read about extra tropical cyclones and cyclonic rain in Chapter 9. Please consult Chapter 9 to understand cyclonic rainfall.\n\n## World Distribution of Rainfall\n\nDifferent places on the earth's surface receive different amounts of rainfall in a year and that too in different seasons.\n\nIn general, as we proceed from the equator towards the poles, rainfall goes on decreasing steadily. The coastal areas of the world receive greater amounts of rainfall than the interior of\nthe continents. The rainfall is more over the oceans than on the landmasses of the world because of being great sources of water. Between the latitudes $35^{\\circ}$ and $40^{\\circ} \\mathrm{N}$ and S of the equator, the rain is heavier on the eastern coasts and goes on decreasing towards the west. But, between $45^{\\circ}$ and $65^{\\circ} \\mathrm{N}$ and S of equator, due to the westerlies, the rainfall is first received on the western margins of the continents and it goes on decreasing towards the east. Wherever mountains run parallel to the coast, the rain is greater on the coastal plain, on the windward side and it decreases towards the leeward side.\n\nOn the basis of the total amount of annual precipitation, major precipitation regimes of the world are identified as follows.\n\nThe equatorial belt, the windward slopes of the mountains along the western coasts in the cool temperate zone and the coastal areas of the monsoon land receive heavy rainfall of over 200 cm per annum. Interior continental areas receive moderate rainfall varying from $100-200 \\mathrm{~cm}$ per annum. The coastal areas of the continents receive moderate amount of rainfall. The central parts of the tropical land and the eastern and interior parts of the temperate lands receive rainfall varying between $50-100 \\mathrm{~cm}$ per annum. Areas lying in the rain shadow zone of the interior of the continents and high latitudes receive very low rainfall-less than 50 cm per annum. Seasonal distribution of rainfall provides an important aspect to judge its effectiveness. In some regions rainfall is distributed evenly throughout the year such as in the equatorial belt and in the western parts of cool temperate regions.\n\n# EXERCISES \n\n1.

Three broad approaches have been adopted for classifying climate. They are empirical, genetic and applied. Empirical classification is based on observed data, particularly on temperature and precipitation. Genetic classification attempts to organise climates according to their causes. Applied classification is for specific purpose.\n\n## Koeppen's Scheme of Classification of Climate\n\nThe most widely used classification of climate is the empirical climate classification scheme developed by V. Koeppen. Koeppen identified a close relationship between the distribution of vegetation and climate. He selected certain values of temperature and precipitation and\nrelated them to the distribution of vegetation and used these values for classifying the climates. It is an empirical classification based on mean annual and mean monthly temperature and precipitation data. He introduced the use of capital and small letters to designate climatic groups and types. Although developed in 1918 and modified over a period of time, Koeppen's scheme is still popular and in use.\n\nKoeppen recognised five major climatic groups, four of them are based on temperature and one on precipitation. Table 11.1 lists the climatic groups and their characteristics according to Koeppen. The capital letters: A,C, D and E delineate humid climates and B dry climates.\n\nThe climatic groups are subdivided into types, designated by small letters, based on seasonality of precipitation and temperature characteristics. The seasons of dryness are indicated by the small letters: $\\mathrm{f}, \\mathrm{m}, \\mathrm{w}$ and s , where f corresponds to no dry season,\n\nTable 11.1 : Climatic Groups According to Koeppen\n\n| Group | Characteristics |\n| :-- | :-- |\n| A - Tropical | Average temperature of the coldest month is 18 C or higher |\n| B - Dry Climates | Potential evaporation exceeds precipitation |\n| C - Warm Temperate | The average temperature of the coldest month of the (Mid-latitude) climates <br> years is higher than minus 3 C but below 18 C |\n| D - Cold Snow Forest Climates | The average temperature of the coldest month is minus 3 C or below |\n| E - Cold Climates | Average temperature for all months is below 10 C |",

The distribution of climatic groups and types is shown in Table 11.1.\nislands of East Indies. Significant amount of rainfall occurs in every month of the year as thunder showers in the afternoon. The temperature is uniformly high and the annual range of temperature is negligible. The maximum temperature on any day is around 30 C while the minimum temperature is around 20 C . Tropical evergreen forests with dense canopy cover and large biodiversity are found in this climate.\n\nTable 11.2 : Climatic Types According to Koeppen\n\n| Group | Type | Letter Code | Characteristics |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| A-Tropical Humid Climate | Tropical wet <br> Tropical monsoon <br> Tropical wet and dry | Af <br> Am <br> Aw | No dry season <br> Monsoonal, short dry season <br> Winter dry season |\n| B-Dry Climate | Subtropical steppe <br> Subtropical desert <br> Mid-latitude steppe <br> Mid-latitude desert | BSh <br> BWh <br> BSk <br> BWk | Low-latitude semi arid or dry <br> Low-latitude arid or dry <br> Mid-latitude semi arid or dry <br> Mid-latitude arid or dry |\n| C-Warm <br> temperate (Mid- <br> latitude) Climates | Humid subtropical <br> Mediterranean <br> Marine west coast | Cfa <br> Cs <br> Cfb | No dry season, warm summer <br> Dry hot summer <br> No dry season, warm and cool summer |\n| D-Cold Snowforest Climates | Humid continental <br> Subarctic | Df <br> Dw | No dry season, severe winter <br> Winter dry and very severe |\n| E-Cold Climates | Tundra <br> Polar ice cap | ET <br> EF | No true summer <br> Perennial ice |\n\n## Group A : Tropical Humid Climates\n\nTropical humid climates exist between Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn. The sun being overhead throughout the year and the presence of Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) make the climate hot and humid. Annual range of temperature is very low and annual rainfall is high. The tropical group is divided into three types, namely (i) Af- Tropical wet climate; (ii) Am - Tropical monsoon climate; (iii) Aw- Tropical wet and dry climate.\n\n## Tropical Wet Climate (Af)\n\nTropical wet climate is found near the equator. The major areas are the Amazon Basin in South America, western equatorial Africa and the\n\n## Tropical Monsoon Climate (Am)\n\nTropical monsoon climate (Am) is found over the Indian sub-continent, North Eastern part of South America and Northern Australia. Heavy rainfall occurs mostly in summer. Winter is dry. The detailed climatic account of this climatic type is given in the book on India: Physical Environment.\n\n## Tropical Wet and Dry Climate (Aw)\n\nTropical wet and dry climate occurs north and south of Af type climate regions. It borders with dry climate on the western part of the continent and Cf or Cw on the eastern part. Extensive Aw climate is found to the north and south of the Amazon forest in Brazil and adjoining parts",

      "content": "of Bolivia and Paraguay in South America, Sudan and south of Central Africa. The annual rainfall in this climate is considerably less than that in Af and Am climate types and is variable also. The wet season is shorter and the dry season is longer with the drought being more severe. Temperature is high throughout the year and diurnal ranges of temperature are the greatest in the dry season. Deciduous forest and tree-shredded grasslands occur in this climate.\n\n## Dry Climates : B\n\nDry climates are characterised by very low rainfall that is not adequate for the growth of plants. These climates cover a very large area of the planet extending over large latitudes from 15 - 60 north and south of the equator. At low latitudes, from 15 - 30 , they occur in the area of subtropical high where subsidence and inversion of temperature do not produce rainfall. On the western margin of the continents, adjoining the cold current, particularly over the west coast of South America, they extend more equatorwards and occur on the coast land. In middle latitudes, from 35 - 60 north and south of equator, they are confined to the interior of continents where maritime-humid winds do not reach and to areas often surrounded by mountains.\n\nDry climates are divided into steppe or semi-arid climate (BS) and desert climate (BW). They are further subdivided as subtropical steppe (BSh) and subtropical desert (BWh) at latitudes from 15 - 35 and mid-latitude steppe (BSk) and mid-latitude desert (BWk) at latitudes between 35 - 60 .\n\n## Subtropical Steppe (BSh) and Subtropical Desert (BWh) Climates\n\nSubtropical steppe (BSh) and subtropical desert (BWh) have common precipitation and temperature characteristics. Located in the transition zone between humid and dry climates, subtropical steppe receives slightly more rainfall than the desert, adequate enough for the growth of sparse grasslands. The rainfall in both the climates is highly variable. The variability in the rainfall affects the life in the steppe much more than in the desert, more\noften causing famine. Rain occurs in short intense thundershowers in deserts and is ineffective in building soil moisture. Fog is common in coastal deserts bordering cold currents. Maximum temperature in the summer is very high. The highest shade temperature of 58 C was recorded at Al Aziziyah, Libya on 13 September 1922. The annual and diurnal ranges of temperature are also high.\n\n## Warm Temperate (Mid-Latitude) Climates-C\n\nWarm temperate (mid-latitude) climates extend from 30 - 50 of latitude mainly on the eastern and western margins of continents. These climates generally have warm summers with mild winters. They are grouped into four types: (i) Humid subtropical, i.e. dry in winter and hot in summer (Cwa); (ii) Mediterranean (Cs); (iii) Humid subtropical, i.e. no dry season and mild winter (Cfa); (iv) Marine west coast climate (Cfb).\n\n## Humid Subtropical Climate (Cwa)\n\nHumid subtropical climate occurs poleward of Tropic of Cancer and Capricorn, mainly in North Indian plains and South China interior plains. The climate is similar to Aw climate except that the temperature in winter is warm.\n\n## Mediterranean Climate (Cs)\n\nAs the name suggests, Mediterranean climate occurs around Mediterranean sea, along the west coast of continents in subtropical latitudes between 30 - 40 latitudes e.g. - Central California, Central Chile, along the coast in south eastern and south western Australia. These areas come under the influence of sub tropical high in summer and westerly wind in winter. Hence, the climate is characterised by hot, dry summer and mild, rainy winter. Monthly average temperature in summer is around 25 C and in winter below 10 C . The annual precipitation ranges between $35-90 \\mathrm{~cm}$.\n\n## Humid Subtropical (Cfa) Climate\n\nHumid subtropical climate lies on the eastern parts of the continent in subtropical latitudes. In this region the air masses are generally",

They occur in eastern United States of America, southern and eastern China, southern Japan, northeastern Argentina, coastal south Africa and eastern coast of Australia. The annual averages of precipitation vary from $75-150 \\mathrm{~cm}$. Thunderstorms in summer and frontal precipitation in winter are common. Mean monthly temperature in summer is around 27 C , and in winter it varies from 5 - 12 C . The daily range of temperature is small.\n\n## Marine West Coast Climate (Cfb)\n\nMarine west coast climate is located poleward from the Mediterranean climate on the west coast of the continents. The main areas are: Northwestern Europe, west coast of North America, north of California, southern Chile, southeastern Australia and New Zealand. Due to marine influence, the temperature is moderate and in winter, it is warmer than for its latitude. The mean temperature in summer months ranges from $15-20 \\mathrm{C}$ and in winter $4-10 \\mathrm{C}$. The annual and daily ranges of temperature are small. Precipitation occurs throughout the year. Precipitation varies greatly from $50-250 \\mathrm{~cm}$.\n\n## Cold Snow Forest Climates (D)\n\nCold snow forest climates occur in the large continental area in the northern hemisphere between 40 - 70 north latitudes in Europe, Asia and North America. Cold snow forest climates are divided into two types: (i) Df- cold climate with humid winter; (ii) Dw- cold climate with dry winter. The severity of winter is more pronounced in higher latitudes.\n\n## Cold Climate with Humid Winters (Df)\n\nCold climate with humid winter occurs poleward of marine west coast climate and mid latitude steppe. The winters are cold and\nsnowy. The frost free season is short. The annual ranges of temperature are large. The weather changes are abrupt and short. Poleward, the winters are more severe.\n\n## Cold Climate with Dry Winters (Dw)\n\nCold climate with dry winter occurs mainly over Northeastern Asia. The development of pronounced winter anti cyclone and its weakening in summer sets in monsoon like reversal of wind in this region. Poleward summer temperatures are lower and winter temperatures are extremely low with many locations experiencing below freezing point temperatures for up to seven months in a year. Precipitation occurs in summer. The annual precipitation is low from $12-15 \\mathrm{~cm}$.\n\n## Polar Climates (E)\n\nPolar climates exist poleward beyond 70 latitude. Polar climates consist of two types: (i) Tundra (ET); (ii) Ice Cap (EF).\n\n## Tundra Climate (ET)\n\nThe tundra climate (ET) is so called after the types of vegetation, like low growing mosses, lichens and flowering plants. This is the region of permafrost where the sub soil is permanently frozen. The short growing season and water logging support only low growing plants. During summer, the tundra regions have very long duration of day light.\n\n## Ice Cap Climate (EF)\n\nThe ice cap climate (EF) occurs over interior Greenland and Antartica. Even in summer, the temperature is below freezing point. This area receives very little precipitation. The snow and ice get accumulated and the mounting pressure causes the deformation of the ice sheets and they break. They move as icebergs that float in the Arctic and Antarctic waters.

      "content": "## Climate Change\n\nThe earlier chapters on climate summarised our understanding of climate as it prevails now. The type of climate we experience now might be prevailing over the last 10,000 years with minor and occasionally wide fluctuations. The planet earth has witnessed many variations in climate since the beginning. Geological records show alteration of glacial and inter-glacial periods. The geomorphological features, especially in high altitudes and high latitudes, exhibit traces of advances and retreats of glaciers. The sediment deposits in glacial lakes also reveal the occurrence of warm and cold periods. The rings in the trees provide clues about wet and dry periods. Historical records describe the vagaries in climate. All these evidences indicate that change in climate is a natural and continuous process.\n\nIndia also witnessed alternate wet and dry periods. Archaeological findings show that the Rajasthan desert experienced wet and cool climate around 8,000 B.C. The period 3,0001,700 B.C. had higher rainfall. From about 2,000-1,700 B.C., this region was the centre of the Harappan civilisation. Dry conditions accentuated since then.\n\nIn the geological past, the earth was warm some 500-300 million years ago, through the Cambrian, Ordovician and Silurian periods. During the Pleistocene epoch, glacial and inter-glacial periods occurred, the last major peak glacial period was about 18,000 years ago. The present inter-glacial period started 10,000 years ago.\n\n## Climate in the recent past\n\nVariability in climate occurs all the time. The nineties decade of the last century witnessed extreme weather events. The 1990s recorded the warmest temperature of the century and some of the worst floods around the world. The worst devastating drought in the Sahel region, south of the Sahara desert, from 1967-1977 is one such variability. During the 1930s, severe drought occurred in southwestern Great Plains of the United States, described as the dust bowl. Historical records of crop yield or\ncrop failures, of floods and migration of people tell about the effects of changing climate. A number of times Europe witnessed warm, wet, cold and dry periods, the significant episodes were the warm and dry conditions in the tenth and eleventh centuries, when the Vikings settled in Greenland. Europe witnessed \"Little Ice Age\" from 1550 to about 1850. From about 1885-1940 world temperature showed an upward trend. After 1940, the rate of increase in temperature slowed down.\n\n## Causes of Climate Change\n\nThe causes for climate change are many. They can be grouped into astronomical and terrestrial causes. The astronomical causes are the changes in solar output associated with sunspot activities. Sunspots are dark and cooler patches on the sun which increase and decrease in a cyclical manner. According to some meteorologists, when the number of sunspots increase, cooler and wetter weather and greater storminess occur. A decrease in sunspot numbers is associated with warm and drier conditions. Yet, these findings are not statistically significant.\n\nAn another astronomical theory is Millankovitch oscillations, which infer cycles in the variations in the earth's orbital characteristics around the sun, the wobbling of the earth and the changes in the earth's axial tilt. All these alter the amount of insolation received from the sun, which in turn, might have a bearing on the climate.\n\nVolcanism is considered as another cause for climate change. Volcanic eruption throws up lots of aerosols into the atmosphere. These aerosols remain in the atmosphere for a considerable period of time reducing the sun's radiation reaching the Earth's surface. After the recent Pinatoba and El Cion volcanic eruptions, the average temperature of the earth fell to some extent for some years.\n\nThe most important anthropogenic effect on the climate is the increasing trend in the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere which is likely to cause global warming.",

      "content": "## Global Warming\n\nDue to the presence of greenhouse gases, the atmosphere is behaving like a greenhouse. The atmosphere also transmits the incoming solar radiation but absorbs the vast majority of long wave radiation emitted upwards by the earth's surface. The gases that absorb long wave radiation are called greenhouse gases. The processes that warm the atmosphere are often collectively referred to as the greenhouse effect.\n\n\n#### Abstract\n\nThe term greenhouse is derived from the analogy to a greenhouse used in cold areas for preserving heat. A greenhouse is made up of glass. The glass which is transparent to incoming short wave solar radiation is opaque to outgoing long wave radiation. The glass, therefore, allows in more radiation and prevents the long wave radiation going outside the glass house, causing the temperature inside the glasshouse structure warmer than outside. When you enter a car or a bus, during summers, where windows are closed, you feel more heat than outside. Likewise during winter the vehicles with closed doors and windows remain warmer than the temperature outside. This is another example of the greenhouse effect.\n\n\n## Greenhouse Gases(GHGs)\n\nThe primary GHGs of concern today are carbon dioxide $\\left(\\mathrm{CO}_{2}\\right)$, Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), methane $\\left(\\mathrm{CH}_{4}\\right)$, nitrous oxide $\\left(\\mathrm{N}_{2} \\mathrm{O}\\right)$ and ozone $\\left(\\mathrm{O}_{3}\\right)$. Some other gases such as nitric oxide (NO) and carbon monoxide (CO) easily react with GHGs and affect their concentration in the atmosphere.\n\nThe effectiveness of any given GHG molecule will depend on the magnitude of the increase in its concentration, its life time in the atmosphere and the wavelength of radiation that it absorbs. The chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are highly effective. Ozone which absorbs ultra violet radiation in the stratosphere is very effective in absorbing terrestrial radiation when it is present in the lower troposphere. Another important point to be noted is that the more time the GHG molecule remains in the atmosphere, the longer\nit will take for earth's atmospheric system to recover from any change brought about by the latter.\n\nThe largest concentration of GHGs in the atmosphere is carbon dioxide. The emission of $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ comes mainly from fossil fuel combustion (oil, gas and coal). Forests and oceans are the sinks for the carbon dioxide. Forests use $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in their growth. So, deforestation due to changes in land use, also increases the concentration of $\\mathrm{Co}_{2}$. The time taken for atmospheric $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ to adjust to changes in sources to sinks is 20-50 years. It is rising at about 0.5 per cent annually. Doubling of concentration of $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ over pre-industrial level is used as an index for estimating the changes in climate in climatic models.\n\nChlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are products of human activity. Ozone occurs in the stratosphere where ultra-violet rays convert oxygen into ozone. Thus, ultra violet rays do not reach the earth's surface. The CFCs which drift into the stratosphere destroy the ozone. Large depletion of ozone occurs over Antarctica. The depletion of ozone concentration in the stratosphere is called the ozone hole. This allows the ultra violet rays to pass through the troposphere.\n\nInternational efforts have been initiated for reducing the emission of GHGs into the atmosphere. The most important one is the Kyoto protocol proclaimed in 1997. This protocol went into effect in 2005, ratified by 141 nations. Kyoto protocol bounds the 35 industrialised countries to reduce their emissions by the year 2012 to 5 per cent less than the levels prevalent in the year 1990.\n\nThe increasing trend in the concentration of GHGs in the atmosphere may, in the long run, warm up the earth. Once the global warming sets in, it will be difficult to reverse it. The effect of global warming may not be uniform everywhere. Nevertheless, the adverse effect due to global warming will adversely affect the life supporting system. Rise in the sea level due to melting of glaciers and ice-caps and thermal expansion of the sea may inundate large parts of the coastal area and islands, leading to social problems. This is another cause for serious concern for the world",

It is said that the water is life. Water is an essential component of all life forms that exist over the surface of the earth. The creatures on the earth are lucky that it is a water planet, otherwise we all would have no existence. Water is a rare commodity in our solar system. There is no water on the sun or anywhere else in the solar system. The earth, fortunately has an abundant supply of water on its surface. Hence, our planet is called the 'Blue Planet'.\n\n## Hydrological Cycle\n\nWater is a cyclic resource. It can be used and re-used. Water also undergoes a cycle from\nthe ocean to land and land to ocean. The hydrological cycle describes the movement of water on, in, and above the earth. The water cycle has been working for billions of years and all the life on earth depends on it. Next to air, water is the most important element required for the existence of life on earth. The distribution of water on earth is quite uneven. Many locations have plenty of water while others have very limited quantity. The hydrological cycle, is the circulation of water within the earth's hydrosphere in different forms i.e. the liquid, solid and the gaseous phases. It also refers to the continuous exchange of water between the oceans,\n\n\n**[IMAGE: A diagram illustrating the hydrological cycle, including processes like precipitation, evaporation, condensation, runoff, and underground flow.]**\n\n\n\nFigure 12.1 : Hydrological Cycle",

The remaining is held as freshwater in glaciers and icecaps, groundwater sources, lakes, soil moisture, atmosphere, streams and within life. Nearly 59 per cent of the water that falls on land returns to the atmosphere through evaporation from over the oceans as well as from other places. The remainder runs-off on the surface, infiltrates into the ground or a part of it becomes glacier.\n\nIt is to be noted that the renewable water on the earth is constant while the demand is increasing tremendously. This leads to water crisis in different parts of the world - spatially and temporally. The pollution of river waters has further aggravated the crisis. How can you intervene in improving the water quality and augmenting the available quantity of water?\n\n## Relief of the Ocean Floor\n\nThe oceans are confined to the great depressions of the earth's outer layer. In this section, we shall see the nature of the ocean basins of the earth and their topography. The oceans, unlike the continents, merge so naturally into one another that it is hard to demarcate them. The geographers have divided the oceanic part of the earth into five oceans, namely the Pacific, the Atlantic, the Indian,\n\nSouthern ocean and the Arctic. The various seas, bays, gulfs and other inlets are parts of these four large oceans.\n\nA major portion of the ocean floor is found between 3-6 km below the sea level. The 'land' under the waters of the oceans, that is, the ocean floor exhibits complex and varied features as those observed over the land (Figure 12.2). The floors of the oceans are rugged with the world's largest mountain ranges, deepest trenches and the largest plains. These features are formed, like those of the continents, by the factors of tectonic, volcanic and depositional processes.\n\n## Divisions of the Ocean Floors\n\nThe ocean floors can be divided into four major divisions: (i) the Continental Shelf; (ii) the Continental Slope; (iii) the Deep Sea Plain; (iv) the Oceanic Deeps. Besides, these divisions there are also major and minor relief features in the ocean floors like ridges, hills, sea mounts, guyots, trenches, canyons, etc.\n\n## Continental Shelf\n\nThe continental shelf is the extended margin of each continent occupied by relatively shallow seas and gulfs. It is the shallowest part of the ocean showing an average gradient of 1 or even less. The shelf typically ends at a very steep slope, called the shelf break.\n\nThe width of the continental shelves vary from one ocean to another. The average width of continental shelves is about 80 km . The shelves are almost absent or very narrow along some of the margins like the coasts of Chile, the west coast of Sumatra, etc. On the contrary, the Siberian shelf in the Arctic Ocean, the largest in the world, stretches to $1,500 \\mathrm{~km}$ in width. The depth of the shelves also varies. It may be as shallow as 30 m in some areas while in some areas it is as deep as 600 m .\n\nThe continental shelves are covered with variable thicknesses of sediments brought down by rivers, glaciers, wind, from the land and distributed by waves and currents. Massive sedimentary deposits received over a long time by the continental shelves, become the source of fossil fuels.",

It begins where the bottom of the continental shelf sharply drops off into a steep slope. The gradient of the slope region varies between 2-5, The depth of the slope region varies between 200 and $3,000 \\mathrm{~m}$. The slope boundary indicates the end of the continents. Canyons and trenches are observed in this region.\n\n## Deep Sea Plain\n\nDeep sea plains are gently sloping areas of the ocean basins. These are the flattest and smoothest regions of the world. The depths\nvary between 3,000 and 6,000m. These plains are covered with fine-grained sediments like clay and silt.\n\n## Oceanic Deeps or Trenches\n\nThese areas are the deepest parts of the oceans. The trenches are relatively steep sided, narrow basins. They are some $3-5 \\mathrm{~km}$ deeper than the surrounding ocean floor. They occur at the bases of continental slopes and along island arcs and are associated with active volcanoes and strong earthquakes. That is why they are very significant in the study of plate movements. As many as 57 deeps have been explored so far; of which 32 are in the Pacific Ocean; 19 in the Atlantic Ocean and 6 in the Indian Ocean.\n\n## Minor Relief Features\n\nApart from the above mentioned major relief features of the ocean floor, some minor but significant features predominate in different parts of the oceans.\n\n## Mid-Oceanic Ridges\n\nA mid-oceanic ridge is composed of two chains of mountains separated by a large depression. The mountain ranges can have peaks as high as $2,500 \\mathrm{~m}$ and some even reach above the ocean's surface. Iceland, a part of the midAtlantic Ridge, is an example.\n\n## Seamount\n\nIt is a mountain with pointed summits, rising from the seafloor that does not reach the surface of the ocean. Seamounts are volcanic in origin. These can be 3,000-4,500 m tall. The Emperor seamount, an extension of the Hawaiian Islands in the Pacific Ocean, is a good example.\n\n## Submarine Canyons\n\nThese are deep valleys, some comparable to the Grand Canyon of the Colorado river. They are sometimes found cutting across the continental shelves and slopes, often extending",

      "content": "from the mouths of large rivers. The Hudson Canyon is the best known submarine canyon in the world.\n\n## Guyots\n\nIt is a flat topped seamount. They show evidences of gradual subsidence through stages to become flat topped submerged mountains. It is estimated that more than 10,000 seamounts and guyots exist in the Pacific Ocean alone.\n\n## Atoll\n\nThese are low islands found in the tropical oceans consisting of coral reefs surrounding a central depression. It may be a part of the sea (lagoon), or sometimes form enclosing a body of fresh, brackish, or highly saline water.\n\n## Temperature of Ocean Waters\n\nThis section deals with the spatial and vertical variations of temperature in various oceans. Ocean waters get heated up by the solar energy just as land. The process of heating and cooling of the oceanic water is slower than land.\n\n## Factors Affecting Temperature Distribution\n\nThe factors which affect the distribution of temperature of ocean water are :\n(i) Latitude: the temperature of surface water decreases from the equator towards the poles because the amount of insolation decreases poleward.\n(ii) Unequal distribution of land and water: the oceans in the northern hemisphere receive more heat due to their contact with larger extent of land than the oceans in the southern hemisphere.\n(iii) Prevailing wind: the winds blowing from the land towards the oceans drive warm surface water away form the coast resulting in the upwelling of cold water from below. It results into the longitudinal variation in the temperature. Contrary to this, the onshore winds pile up warm water near the coast and this raises the temperature.\n(iv) Ocean currents : warm ocean currents raise the temperature in cold areas while the cold currents decrease the temperature in warm ocean areas. Gulf stream (warm current) raises the temperature near the eastern coast of North America and the West Coast of Europe while the Labrador current (cold current) lowers the temperature near the north-east coast of North America.\nAll these factors influence the temperature of the ocean currents locally. The enclosed seas in the low latitudes record relatively higher temperature than the open seas; whereas the enclosed seas in the high latitudes have lower temperature than the open seas.\n\n## Horizontal and Vertical Distribution of Temperature\n\nThe temperature-depth profile for the ocean water shows how the temperature decreases with the increasing depth. The profile shows a boundary region between the surface waters of the ocean and the deeper layers. The boundary usually begins around $100-400 \\mathrm{~m}$ below the sea surface and extends several hundred of metres downward (Figure 12.3). This boundary region, from where there is a rapid decrease of temperature, is called the thermocline. About 90 per cent of the total volume of water is found below the thermocline in the deep ocean. In this zone, temperatures approach 0 C .\n\nThe temperature structure of oceans over middle and low latitudes can be described as a three-layer system from surface to the bottom.\n\nThe first layer represents the top layer of warm oceanic water and it is about 500 m thick with temperatures ranging between 20 and 25 C . This layer, within the tropical region, is present throughout the year but in mid latitudes it develops only during summer.\n\nThe second layer called the thermocline layer lies below the first layer and is characterised by rapid decrease in temperature with increasing depth. The thermocline is $500-1,000 \\mathrm{~m}$ thick.\n\nThe third layer is very cold and extends upto the deep ocean floor. In the Arctic and",

Here, only one layer of cold water exists, which extends from surface to deep ocean floor.\n\nThe average temperature of surface water of the oceans is about 27 C and it gradually decreases from the equator towards the poles. The rate of decrease of temperature with increasing latitude is generally 0.5 C per latitude. The average temperature is around 22 C at 20 latitudes, 14 C at 40 latitudes and 0 C near poles. The oceans in the northern hemisphere record relatively higher temperature than in the southern hemisphere. The highest temperature is not recorded at the equator but slightly towards north of it. The average annual temperatures for the northern and southern hemisphere are around 19 C and 16 C respectively. This variation is due to the unequal distribution of land and water in the northern and southern hemispheres.\n\nFigure 12.4 shows the spatial pattern of surface temperature of the oceans.\n\nIt is a well known fact that the maximum temperature of the oceans is always at their surfaces because they directly receive the heat from the sun and the heat is transmitted to the lower sections of the oceans through the process of convection. It results into decrease of temperature with the increasing depth, but the rate of decrease is not uniform throughout. The temperature falls very rapidly up to the depth of 200 m and thereafter, the rate of decrease of temperature is slowed down.\n\n## Salinity of Ocean Waters\n\nAll waters in nature, whether rain water or ocean water, contain dissolved mineral salts. Salinity is the term used to define the total content of dissolved salts in sea water (Table 12.4). It is calculated as the amount of salt (in gm ) dissolved in $1,000 \\mathrm{gm}(1 \\mathrm{~kg})$ of seawater. It is usually expressed as parts per thousand $\\left({ }^{\\circ} /{ }_{\\infty}\\right)$ or ppt. Salinity is an important property of sea water. Salinity of $24.7 \\%$ has been considered as the upper limit to demarcate 'brackish water'.\n\nFactors affecting ocean salinity are mentioned below:\n(i) The salinity of water in the surface layer of oceans depend mainly on evaporation and precipitation.\n(ii) Surface salinity is greatly influenced in coastal regions by the fresh water flow from rivers, and in polar regions by the processes of freezing and thawing of ice.\n(iii) Wind, also influences salinity of an area by transferring water to other areas.\n(iv) The ocean currents contribute to the salinity variations. Salinity, temperature and density of water are interrelated. Hence, any change in the temperature or density influences the salinity of water in an area.\n\nHighest salinity in water bodies Lake Van in Turkey $\\left(330 \\%{ }^{\\circ}\\right)$, Dead Sea $\\left(238 \\%{ }^{\\circ}\\right)$, Great Salt Lake $\\left(220 \\%{ }^{\\circ}\\right)$",

In the land locked Red Sea, it is as high as $41 \\%$, while in the estuaries and the Arctic, the salinity fluctuates from $0-35 \\%$, seasonally. In hot and dry regions, where evaporation is high, the salinity sometimes reaches to $70 \\%$.\n\nThe salinity variation in the Pacific Ocean is mainly due to its shape and larger areal extent. Salinity decreases from $35 \\%$ - $31 \\%$ on the western parts of the northern hemisphere because of the influx of melted water from the Arctic region. In the same way, after 15 - 20 south, it decreases to $33 \\%$.\n\nThe average salinity of the Atlantic Ocean is around $36 \\%$. The highest salinity is recorded between 15 and 20 latitudes. Maximum salinity ( $37 \\%$ ) is observed between 20 N and 30 N and $20 \\mathrm{~W}-60 \\mathrm{~W}$. It gradually decreases towards the north.\n\nThe North Sea, in spite of its location in higher latitudes, records higher salinity due to more saline water brought by the North Atlantic Drift. Baltic Sea records low salinity due to influx of river waters in large quantity. The Mediterranean Sea records higher salinity due to high evaporation. Salinity is, however, very low in Black Sea due to enormous fresh water influx by rivers. See the atlas to find out the rivers joining Black Sea.\n\nThe average salinity of the Indian Ocean is $35 \\%$. The low salinity trend is observed in the Bay of Bengal due to influx of river water. On the contrary, the Arabian Sea shows higher salinity due to high evaporation and low influx of fresh water.

Salinity at depth is very much fixed, because there is no way that water is 'lost', or the salt is 'added.' There is a marked difference in the salinity between the surface zones and the deep zones of the oceans. The lower salinity water rests above\nthe higher salinity dense water. Salinity, generally, increases with depth and there is a distinct zone called the halocline, where salinity increases sharply.

Its physical characteristics like temperature, salinity, density and the external forces like of the sun, moon and the winds influence the movement of ocean water. The horizontal and vertical motions are common in ocean water bodies. The horizontal motion refers to the ocean currents and waves. The vertical motion refers to tides. Ocean currents are the continuous flow of huge amount of water in a definite direction while the waves are the horizontal motion of water. Water moves ahead from one place to another through ocean currents while the water in the waves does not move, but the wave trains move ahead. The vertical motion refers to the rise and fall of water in the oceans and seas. Due to attraction of the sun and the moon, the ocean water is raised up and falls down twice a day. The upwelling of cold water from subsurface and the sinking of surface water are also forms of vertical motion of ocean water.\n\n## Waves\n\nWaves are actually the energy, not the water as such, which moves across the ocean surface. Water particles only travel in a small circle as a wave passes. Wind provides energy to the waves. Wind causes waves to travel in the ocean and the energy is released on shorelines. The motion of the surface water seldom affects the stagnant deep bottom water of the oceans. As a wave approaches the beach, it slows down. This is due to the friction occurring between the dynamic water and the sea floor. And, when the depth of water is less than half the wavelength of the wave, the wave breaks. The largest waves are found in the open oceans. Waves continue to grow larger as they move and absorb energy from the wind.\n\nMost of the waves are caused by the wind driving against water. When a breeze of two knots or less blows over calm water, small ripples form and grow as the wind speed increases until white caps appear in the breaking waves. Waves may travel thousands of km before rolling ashore, breaking and dissolving as surf.\n\nA wave's size and shape reveal its origin. Steep waves are fairly young ones and are probably formed by local wind. Slow and steady waves originate from far away places, possibly from another hemisphere. The maximum wave height is determined by the strength of the wind, i.e. how long it blows and the area over which it blows in a single direction.\n\nWaves travel because wind pushes the water body in its course while gravity pulls the crests of the waves downward. The falling water pushes the former troughs upward, and the\n\n\n**[IMAGE: Diagram illustrating the movement of a wave traveling to the right, showing the rising of troughs and the falling of crests.]**\n\n\n\nFigure 13.1: Motion of waves and water molecules",

It indicates that things are carried up and forward as the wave approaches, and down and back as it passes.\n\n## Characteristics of Waves\n\nWave crest and trough : The highest and lowest points of a wave are called the crest and trough respectively.\nWave height : It is the vertical distance from the bottom of a trough to the top of a crest of a wave.\nWave amplitude : It is one-half of the wave height.\nWave period: It is merely the time interval between two successive wave crests or troughs as they pass a fixed point.\nWavelength : It is the horizontal distance between two successive crests.\nWave speed : It is the rate at which the wave moves through the water, and is measured in knots.\nWave frequency: It is the number of waves passing a given point during a one second time interval.\n\n## Tides\n\nThe periodical rise and fall of the sea level, once or twice a day, mainly due to the attraction of the sun and the moon, is called a tide. Movement of water caused by meteorological effects (winds and atmospheric pressure changes) are called surges. Surges are not regular like tides. The study of tides is very complex, spatially and temporally, as it has great variations in frequency, magnitude and height.\n\nThe moon's gravitational pull to a great extent and to a lesser extent the sun's gravitational pull, are the major causes for the occurrence of tides. Another factor is centrifugal force, which is the force that acts to counter balance the gravity. Together, the gravitational pull and the centrifugal force are responsible for creating the two major tidal bulges on the earth. On the side of the earth facing the moon, a tidal bulge occurs while on the opposite side though the gravitational attraction of the moon\nis less as it is farther away, the centrifugal force causes tidal bulge on the other side (Figure 13.2).\n\nThe 'tide-generating' force is the difference between these two forces; i.e. the gravitational attraction of the moon and the centrifugal force. On the surface of the earth, nearest the moon, pull or the attractive force of the moon is greater than the centrifugal force, and so there is a net force causing a bulge towards the moon. On the opposite side of the earth, the attractive force is less, as it is farther away from the moon, the centrifugal force is dominant. Hence, there is a net force away from the moon. It creates the second bulge away from the moon. On the surface of the earth, the horizontal tide generating forces are more important than the vertical forces in generating the tidal bulges.\n\n\n**[IMAGE: Diagram explaining the formation of tidal bulges due to gravitational and centrifugal forces between the Earth, Moon, and Sun.]**\n\n\n\nFigure 13.2 : Relation between gravitational forces and tides\n\nThe tidal bulges on wide continental shelves, have greater height. When tidal bulges hit the mid-oceanic islands they become low. The shape of bays and estuaries along a coastline can also magnify the intensity of tides. Funnel-shaped bays greatly change tidal magnitudes. When the tide is channelled between islands or into bays and estuaries they are called tidal currents.",

      "content": "## Tides of Bay of Fundy, Canada\n\nThe highest tides in the world occur in the Bay of Fundy in Nova Scotia, Canada. The tidal bulge is $15-16 \\mathrm{~m}$. Because there are two high tides and two low tides every day (roughly a 24 hour period); then a tide must come in within about a six hour period. As a rough estimate, the tide rises about 240 cm an hour ( $1,440 \\mathrm{~cm}$ divided by 6 hours). If you have walked down a beach with a steep cliff alongside (which is common there), make sure you watch the tides. If you walk for about an hour and then notice that the tide is coming in, the water will be over your head before you get back to where you started!\n\n## Types of Tides\n\nTides vary in their frequency, direction and movement from place to place and also from time to time. Tides may be grouped into various types based on their frequency of occurrence in one day or 24 hours or based on their height.\n\n## Tides based on Frequency\n\nSemi-diurnal tide : The most common tidal pattern, featuring two high tides and two low tides each day. The successive high or low tides are approximately of the same height.\n\nDiurnal tide : There is only one high tide and one low tide during each day. The successive high and low tides are approximately of the same height.\n\nMixed tide : Tides having variations in height are known as mixed tides. These tides generally occur along the west coast of North America and on many islands of the Pacific Ocean.\n\n## Tides based on the Sun, Moon and the Earth Positions\n\nThe height of rising water (high tide) varies appreciably depending upon the position of sun and moon with respect to the earth. Spring tides and neap tides come under this category.\n\nSpring tides: The position of both the sun and the moon in relation to the earth has direct bearing on tide height. When the sun, the moon and the earth are in a straight line, the height of the tide will be higher. These are called spring tides and they occur twice a month, one on full moon period and another during new moon period.\n\nNeap tides : Normally, there is a seven day interval between the spring tides and neap tides. At this time the sun and moon are at right angles to each other and the forces of the sun and moon tend to counteract one another. The Moon's attraction, though more than twice as strong as the sun's, is diminished by the counteracting force of the sun's gravitational pull.\n\nOnce in a month, when the moon's orbit is closest to the earth (perigee), unusually high and low tides occur. During this time the tidal range is greater than normal. Two weeks later, when the moon is farthest from earth (apogee), the moon's gravitational force is limited and the tidal ranges are less than their average heights.\n\nWhen the earth is closest to the sun (perihelion), around 3rd January each year, tidal ranges are also much greater, with unusually high and unusually low tides. When the earth is farthest from the sun (aphelion), around 4th July each year, tidal ranges are much less than average.\n\nThe time between the high tide and low tide, when the water level is falling, is called the $e b b$. The time between the low tide and high tide, when the tide is rising, is called the flow or flood.\n\n## Importance of Tides\n\nSince tides are caused by the earth-moon-sun positions which are known accurately, the tides can be predicted well in advance. This helps the navigators and fishermen plan their activities. Tidal flows are of great importance in navigation. Tidal heights are very important, especially harbours near rivers and within estuaries having shallow 'bars' at the entrance, which prevent ships and boats from entering into the harbour. Tides are also helpful in",

Ocean currents are influenced by two types of forces namely : (i) primary forces that initiate the movement of water; (ii) secondary forces that influence the currents to flow.\n\nThe primary forces that influence the currents are: (i) heating by solar energy; (ii) wind; (iii) gravity; (iv) coriolis force. Heating by solar energy causes the water to expand. That is why, near the equator the ocean water is about 8 cm higher in level than in the middle latitudes. This causes a very slight gradient and water tends to flow down the slope. Wind blowing on the surface of the ocean pushes the water to move. Friction between the wind and the water surface affects the movement of the water body in its course. Gravity tends to pull the water down the pile and create gradient variation. The Coriolis force intervenes and causes the water to move to the right in the northern hemisphere and to the left in the southern hemisphere. These large accumulations of water and the flow around them are called Gyres. These produce large circular currents in all the ocean basins.\n\nCharacteristics of Ocean Currents\nCurrents are referred to by their \"drift\". Usually, the currents are strongest near the surface and may attain speeds over five knots. At depths, currents are generally slow with speeds less than 0.5 knots. We refer to the speed of a current as its \"drift.\" Drift is measured in terms of knots. The strength of a current refers to the speed of the current. A fast current is considered strong. A current is usually strongest at the surface and decreases in strength (speed) with depth. Most currents have speeds less than or equal to 5 knots.\n\nDifferences in water density affect vertical mobility of ocean currents. Water with high salinity is denser than water with low salinity and in the same way cold water is denser than warm water. Denser water tends to sink, while relatively lighter water tends to rise. Cold-water ocean currents occur when the cold water at the poles sinks and slowly moves towards the equator. Warm-water currents travel out from the equator along the surface, flowing towards the poles to replace the sinking cold water.\n\n## Types of Ocean Currents\n\nThe ocean currents may be classified based on their depth as surface currents and deep water currents : (i) surface currents constitute about 10 per cent of all the water in the ocean, these waters are the upper 400 m of the ocean; (ii) deep water currents make up the other 90 per cent of the ocean water. These waters move around the ocean basins due to variations in the density and gravity. Deep waters sink into the deep ocean basins at high latitudes, where the temperatures are cold enough to cause the density to increase.\n\nOcean currents can also be classified based on temperature : as cold currents and warm currents: (i) cold currents bring cold water into warm water areas. These currents are usually found on the west coast of the continents in the low and middle latitudes (true in both hemispheres) and on the east coast in the higher latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere; (ii) warm currents bring warm water into cold water areas and are usually observed on the east coast of continents in the low and middle latitudes (true in both hemispheres). In the northern hemisphere they are found on the west coasts of continents in high latitudes.\n\n## Major Ocean Currents\n\nMajor ocean currents are greatly influenced by the stresses exerted by the prevailing winds and coriolis force. The oceanic circulation pattern roughly corresponds to the earth's atmospheric circulation pattern. The air circulation over the oceans in the middle latitudes is mainly anticyclonic (more pronounced in the southern hemisphere than in the northern hemisphere). The oceanic circulation pattern also corresponds with the same. At higher latitudes,",

In regions of pronounced monsoonal flow, the monsoon winds influence the current movements. Due to the coriolis force, the warm currents from low latitudes tend to move to the right in the northern hemisphere and to their left in the southern hemisphere.\n\nThe oceanic circulation transports heat from one latitude belt to another in a manner similar to the heat transported by the general circulation of the atmosphere. The cold waters of the Arctic and Antarctic circles move towards warmer water in tropical and equatorial regions, while the warm waters of the lower latitudes move polewards. The major currents in the different oceans are shown in Figure13.3.\n\nPrepare a list of currents which are found in Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans.\nHow is the movement of currents influenced by prevailing winds? Give some examples from Figure13.3.\n\n## Effects of Ocean Currents\n\nOcean currents have a number of direct and indirect influences on human activities. West coasts of the continents in tropical and subtropical latitudes (except close to the equator) are bordered by cool waters. Their average temperatures are relatively low with a narrow diurnal and annual ranges. There is fog, but generally the areas are arid. West coasts of the continents in the middle and higher latitudes are bordered by warm waters which cause a distinct marine climate. They are characterised by cool summers and relatively mild winters with a narrow annual range of temperatures. Warm currents flow parallel to the east coasts of the continents in tropical and subtropical latitudes. This results in warm and rainy climates. These areas lie in the western margins of the subtropical anti-cyclones. The mixing of warm and cold currents help to replenish the oxygen and favour the growth of planktons, the primary food for fish population. The best fishing grounds of the world exist mainly in these mixing zones.",

See the Figure 5.2 in Chapter 5 in order to recapitulate. You should know that this weathering mantle is the basis for the diversity of vegetation and hence, the biodiversity. The basic cause for such weathering variations and resultant biodiversity is the input of solar energy and water. No wonder that the areas that are rich in these inputs are the areas of wide spectrum of biodiversity.\n\nBiodiversity as we have today is the result of 2.5-3.5 billion years of evolution. Before the advent of humans, our earth supported more biodiversity than in any other period. Since, the emergence of humans, however, biodiversity has begun a rapid decline, with one species after another bearing the brunt of extinction due to overuse. The number of species globally vary from 2 million to 100 million, with 10 million being the best estimate. New species are regularly discovered most of which are yet to be classified (an estimate states that about 40 per cent of fresh water fishes from South America are not classified yet). Tropical forests are very rich in bio-diversity.\n\nBiodiversity is a system in constant evolution, from a view point of species, as well as from view point of an individual organism. The average half-life of a species is estimated at between one and four million years, and 99 per cent of the species that have ever lived on\nthe earth are today extinct. Biodiversity is not found evenly on the earth. It is consistently richer in the tropics. As one approaches the polar regions, one finds larger and larger populations of fewer and fewer species.\n\nBiodiversity itself is a combination of two words, Bio (life) and diversity (variety). In simple terms, biodiversity is the number and variety of organisms found within a specified geographic region. It refers to the varieties of plants, animals and micro-organisms, the genes they contain and the ecosystems they form. It relates to the variability among living organisms on the earth, including the variability within and between the species and that within and between the ecosystems. Biodiversity is our living wealth. It is a result of hundreds of millions of years of evolutionary history.\n\nBiodiversity can be discussed at three levels : (i) Genetic diversity; (ii) Species diversity; (iii) Ecosystem diversity.\n\n## Genetic Diversity\n\nGenes are the basic building blocks of various life forms. Genetic biodiversity refers to the variation of genes within species. Groups of individual organisms having certain similarities in their physical characteristics are called species. Human beings genetically belong to the homo sapiens group and also differ in their characteristics such as height, colour, physical appearance, etc., considerably. This is due to genetic diversity. This genetic diversity is essential for a healthy breeding of population of species.",

      "content": "## Species Diversity\n\nThis refers to the variety of species. It relates to the number of species in a defined area. The diversity of species can be measured through its richness, abundance and types. Some areas are more rich in species than others. Areas rich in species diversity are called hotspots of diversity (Figure 14.5).\n\n## Ecosystem Diversity\n\nYou have studied about the ecosystem in the earlier chapter. The broad differences between ecosystem types and the diversity of habitats and ecological processes occurring within each ecosystem type constitute the ecosystem diversity. The 'boundaries' of communities (associations of species) and ecosystems are not very rigidly defined. Thus, the demarcation of ecosystem boundaries is difficult and complex.\n\n\n**[IMAGE: A photograph depicting a landscape with hills and vegetation.]**\n\n\n\nFigure 14.1 : Grasslands and sholas in Indira Gandhi National Park, Annamalai, Western Ghats - an example of ecosystem diversity\n\n## Importance of Biodiversity\n\nBiodiversity has contributed in many ways to the development of human culture and, in turn, human communities have played a major role in shaping the diversity of nature at the genetic, species and ecological levels. Biodiversity plays the following roles: ecological, economic and scientific.\n\n## Ecological Role of Biodiversity\n\nSpecies of many kinds perform some function or the other in an ecosystem. Nothing in an\necosystem evolves and sustains without any reason. That means, every organism, besides extracting its needs, also contributes something of useful to other organisms. Can you think of the way we, humans contribute to the sustenance of ecosystems. Species capture and store energy, produce and decompose organic materials, help to cycle water and nutrients throughout the ecosystem, fix atmospheric gases and help regulate the climate. These functions are important for ecosystem function and human survival. The more diverse an ecosystem, better are the chances for the species to survive through adversities and attacks, and consequently, is more productive. Hence, the loss of species would decrease the ability of the system to maintain itself. Just like a species with a high genetic diversity, an ecosystem with high biodiversity may have a greater chance of adapting to environmental change. In other words, the more the variety of species in an ecosystem, the more stable the ecosystem is likely to be.\n\n## Economic Role of Biodiversity\n\nFor all humans, biodiversity is an important resource in their day-to-day life. One important part of biodiversity is 'crop diversity', which is also called agro-biodiversity. Biodiversity is seen as a reservoir of resources to be drawn upon for the manufacture of food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic products. This concept of biological resources is responsible for the deterioration of biodiversity. At the same time, it is also the origin of new conflicts dealing with rules of division and appropriation of natural resources. Some of the important economic commodities that biodiversity supplies to humankind are: food crops, livestock, forests, fish, medicinal resources, etc.\n\n## Scientific Role of Biodiversity\n\nBiodiversity is important because each species can give us some clue as to how life evolved and will continue to evolve. Biodiversity also helps in understanding how life functions and the role of each species in sustaining",

This fact must be drawn upon every one of us so that we live and let other species also live their lives.\n\nIt is our ethical responsibility to consider that each and every species along with us have an intrinsic right to exist. Hence, it is morally wrong to voluntarily cause the extinction of any species. The level of biodiversity is a good indicator of the state of our relationships with other living species. In fact, the concept of biodiversity is an integral part of many human cultures.\n\n## Loss of Biodiversity\n\nSince the last few decades, growth in human population has increased the rate of consumption of natural resources. It has accelerated the loss of species and habitation in different parts of the world. Tropical regions which occupy only about one-fourth of the total area of the world, contain about threefourth of the world human population. Overexploitation of resources and deforestation have become rampant to fulfil the needs of large population. As these tropical rain forests contain 50 per cent of the species on the earth, destruction of natural habitats have proved disastrous for the entire biosphere.\n\nNatural calamities such as earthquakes, floods, volcanic eruptions, forest fires, droughts, etc. cause damage to the flora and fauna of the earth, bringing change the biodiversity of respective affected regions. Pesticides and other pollutants such as hydrocarbons and toxic heavy metals destroy the weak and sensitive species. Species which are not the natural inhabitants of the local habitat but are introduced into the system, are called exotic species. There are many examples when a natural biotic community of the ecosystem suffered extensive damage because of the introduction of exotic species. During the last few decades, some animals like tigers, elephants, rhinoceros, crocodiles, minks and birds were hunted mercilessly by poachers for their horn, tusks, hides, etc. It has resulted in the rendering of certain types of organisms as endangered category.\n\nThe International Union of Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) has classified the threatened species of plants and animals into three categories for the purpose of their conservation.\n\n## Endangered Species\n\nIt includes those species which are in danger of extinction. The IUCN publishes information about endangered species world-wide as the Red List of threatened species.\n\n\n**[IMAGE: A photograph of red pandas in their natural habitat.]**\n\n\n\nFigure 14.2 : Red Panda - an endangered species\n\n## Vulnerable Species\n\nThis includes the species which are likely to be in danger of extinction in near future if the factors threatening to their extinction continue. Survival of these species is not assured as their population has reduced greatly.\n\n## Rare Species\n\nPopulation of these species is very small in the world; they are confined to limited areas or thinly scattered over a wider area.\n\n## Conservation of Biodiversity\n\nBiodiversity is important for human existence. All forms of life are so closely interlinked that disturbance in one gives rise to imbalance in the others. If species of plants and animals become endangered, they cause degradation in the environment, which may threaten human being's own existence.",

There is an increasing consciousness of the fact that such conservation with sustainable use is possible only with the involvement and cooperation of local communities and individuals. For this, the development of institutional structures at local levels is necessary. The critical problem is not merely the conservation of species nor the habitat but the continuation of process of conservation.\n\nThe Government of India along with 155 other nations have signed the Convention of Biodiversity at the Earth Summit held at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in June 1992. The world conservation strategy has suggested the following steps for biodiversity conservation:\n(i) Efforts should be made to preserve the species that are endangered.\n(ii) Prevention of extinction requires proper planning and management.\n(iii) Varieties of food crops, forage plants, timber trees, livestock, animals and their wild relatives should be preserved;\n(iv) Each country should identify habitats of wild relatives and ensure their protection.\n(v) Habitats where species feed, breed, rest and nurse their young should be safeguarded and protected.\n(vi) International trade in wild plants and animals be regulated.\nTo protect, preserve and propagate the variety of species within natural boundaries, the Government of India passed the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, under which national parks and sanctuaries were established and biosphere reserves declared. Details of these biosphere reserves are given in the book India: Physical Environment (NCERT, 2006).\n\nThere are some countries which are situated in the tropical region; they possess a large number of the world's species diversity. They are called mega diversity centres. There are 12 such countries, namely Mexico, Columbia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Democratic Republic of Congo, Madagascar, China, India, Malaysia, Indonesia and Australia in which these centres are located. In order to concentrate resources on those areas that are most vulnerable, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) has identified certain areas as biodiversity hotspots (Figure 14.1). Hotspots are defined according to their vegetation. Plants are important because these determine the primary productivity of an ecosystem. Most, but not all, of the hotspots rely on species-rich ecosystems for food, firewood, cropland, and income from timber. In Madagascar, for example, about 85 per cent of the plants and animals are found nowhere else in the world, Other hotspots in wealthy countries are facing different types of pressures. The islands of Hawaii have many unique plants and animals that are threatened by introduced species and land development.",
