You may also know that the shape of the earth is geoid (three-dimensional) and a globe can best represent it (Fig. 1.1). A map, on the other hand, is a simplified depiction of whole or part of the earth on a piece of paper. In other words, it is a two-dimensional form of the three-dimensional earth. Hence, a map can be drawn using a system of map projections (see Chapter 4). As it is impossible to represent all features of the earth's surface in their true size and form, a map is drawn at a reduced scale. Imagine your school campus. If a plan/map of your school is to be drawn in its actual size, it will be as large as the campus itself. Hence, maps are drawn at a scale and projection so that each point on the paper corresponds to the actual ground position. Besides, the representation of different features is also simplified using symbols, colours and shades. A map is, therefore, defined as selective, symbolised and generalised representation of whole or a",

It is only referred to as \"the sketch\" (Fig. 1.2). In the present chapter, we will study the essential requirements of maps, their types and the uses.\n\n# Essentials of Map Making \n\nIn view of the variety of maps, we may find it difficult to summarise what they all have in common. Cartography, being an art and science of mapmaking, does include a series of processes that are common to all the maps. These processes that may also be referred to as essentials of maps are :\n\nScale\nMap Projection\nMap Generalisation\nMap Design\nMap Construction and Production\n\nScale: We know that all maps are reductions. The first decision that a map-maker has to take is about the scale of the map. The choice of scale is of utmost importance. The scale of a map sets limits of information contents and the degree of reality with which it can be delineated on the map. For example, figure 1.3 provides a comparison between maps having different scales and the improvements made thereupon with the change in scale.\n\nProjection: We also know that maps are a simplified representation of the three-dimensional surface of the earth on a plane sheet of paper. The transformation of all-side-curved-geoidal surface into a plane surface is another important aspect of the cartographic process. We should know that such a radical transformation introduces some unavoidable changes in directions, distances, areas and shapes from the way they appear on a geoid. A system of transformation of the spherical surface to the plane surface is called a map projection. Hence, the choice, utilisation and construction of projections is of prime importance in map-making.",

For example, a general purpose map is drawn to show information of a general nature such as relief, drainage, vegetation, settlements, means of transportation, etc. Similarly, a special purpose map exhibits information pertaining to one or more selected themes like population density, soil types or location of industries. It is, therefore, necessary to carefully plan the map contents while the purpose of the map must be kept in the forefront. As maps are drawn at a reduced scale to serve a definite purpose, the third task of a cartographer is to generalise the map contents. In doing so, a cartographer must select the information (data) relevant to the selected theme and simplify it as per the needs.\n\nMap Design: The fourth important task of a cartographer is the map design. It involves the planning of graphic characteristics of maps including the selection of appropriate symbols, their size and form, style of lettering, specifying the width of lines, selection of colours and shades, arrangement of various elements of map design within a map and design for map legend. The map design is, therefore, a complex aspect of mapmaking and requires thorough understanding of the principles that govern the effectiveness of graphic communication.\n\nMap Construction and Production: The drawing of maps and their reproduction is the fifth major task in the cartographic process. In earlier times, much of the map construction and reproduction work used to be carried out manually. Maps were drawn with pen and ink and printed mechanically. However, the map construction and reproduction has been revolutionalised with the addition of computer assisted mapping and photo-printing techniques in the recent past.\n\n# History of Map Making \n\nThe history of map making is as old as the history of mankind itself. The oldest map was found in Mesopotamia drawn on a clay tablet that belongs to 2,500 B.C. Figure 1.4 shows Ptolemy's Map of the World. Greek and the Arab geographers laid the foundation of modern cartography. The measurement of the circumference of the Earth and the use of the system of geographical coordinates in map-making are some of the significant contributions of the Greeks and the Arabs.

The maps were drawn on different projections to obtain true directions, correct distances and to measure area accurately. The aerial photography supplemented the ground method of survey and the uses of aerial photographs stimulated map-making in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.\nThe foundation of map-making in India was laid during the Vedic period when the expressions of astronomical truths and cosmological revelations were made. The expressions were crystallised into 'sidhantas' or laws in classical treaties of Arya Bhatta, Varahamihira and Bhaskara, and others. Ancient Indian scholars divided the known world into seven 'dwipas' (Fig. 1.5). Mahabharata conceived a round world surrounded by water (Fig. 1.6).\n\n\n**[IMAGE: A map depicting ancient Indian geography with different regions labeled.]**\n\n\n\nFigure 1.5 Seven Dwipas of the World as conceived in Ancient India\n\n\n**[IMAGE: Diagram of ancient Indian cosmology showing different varsas and oceans.]**\n\n\n\nFigure 1.6 Round World surrounded by water as conceived in Mahabharata",

      "content": "Todarmal pioneered land surveying and map-making as an integral part of the revenue collection procedure. Besides, Sher Shah Suri's revenue maps further enriched the mapping techniques during the medieval period. The intensive topographical surveys for the preparation of up-to-date maps of the entire country, were taken up with the setting up of the Survey of India in 1767, which culminated with the map of Hindustan in 1785. Today, the Survey of India produces maps at different scales for the entire country.\n\nTypes of Maps Based on Scale: On the basis of scale, maps may be classified into large-scale and small-scale. Large scale maps are drawn to show small areas at a relatively large-scale. For example, the topographical maps drawn at a scale of $1: 250,000,1: 50,000$ or $1: 25,000$ and the village maps, the zonal plans of the cities and house plans prepared on a scale of $1: 4,000,1: 2,000$ and 1:500 are large scale maps. On the other hand, small-scale maps are drawn to show large areas. For example, atlas maps, wall maps, etc.\n(i) Large-scale Maps: Large-scale maps are further divided into the following types :\n(a) Cadastral maps\n(b) Topographical maps\n(a) Cadastral Maps : The term 'cadastral' is derived from the French word 'cadastre' meaning 'register of territorial property'. These maps are drawn to show the ownership of landed property by demarcating field boundaries of agricultural land and the plan of individual houses in urban areas. The cadastral maps are prepared by the government agencies to realise revenue and taxes, along with keeping a record of ownership. These maps are drawn on a very large scale, such as the cadastral maps of villages at $1: 4,000$ scale and the city plans at a scale of $1: 2,000$ and larger.\n(b) Topographical Maps: These maps are also prepared on a fairly large scale. The topographical maps are based on precise surveys and are prepared in the form of series of maps made by the national mapping agencies of almost all countries of the world (Chapter 5). For example, the Survey of India undertakes the topographical mapping of the entire country at $1: 250,000,1: 50,000$ and $1: 25,000$ scale (Fig. 1.3). These maps follow uniform colours and symbols to show topographic details such as relief, drainage, agricultural land, forest, settlements, means of",

The scale of wall maps is generally smaller than the scale of topographical maps but larger than atlas maps.\n(b) Atlas Maps : Atlas maps are very small-scale maps. These maps represent fairly large areas and present highly generalised picture of the physical or cultural features. Even so, an atlas map serves as a graphic encyclopaedia of the geographical information about the world, continents, countries or regions. When consulted properly, these maps provide a wealth of generalised information regarding location, relief, drainage, climate, vegetation, distribution of cities and towns, population, location of industries, transport-network system, tourism and heritage sites, etc.\n\nTypes of Maps Based on Function: The maps may also be classified on the basis of their functions. For example, a political map serves the function of providing administrative divisions of a continent or a country and a soil map shows the distribution of different types of soils. Broadly, maps based on their functions may be classified into physical maps and cultural maps.\n(i) Physical Maps: Physical maps show natural features such as relief, geology, soils, drainage, elements of weather, climate and vegetation, etc.\n(a) Relief Maps: Relief maps show general topography of an area like mountains and valleys, plains, plateaus and drainage. Figure 1.7 shows the relief and slope map of Nagpur district.\n(b) Geological Maps: These maps are drawn to show geological structures, rock types, etc. Figure 1.8 shows the distribution of rocks and minerals in Nagpur district.\n(c) Climatic Maps : These maps depict climatic regions of an area.

In doing so, they make various types of measurements to determine distances, directions and area.\n\nMeasurement of Distance: The linear features shown on the maps fall into two broad categories, i.e. straight lines and erratic or zigzag lines. The measurement of straight line features like roads, railway lines and canals is simple. It can be taken directly with a pair of dividers or a scale placed on the map surface. However, distances are required, more often, along erratic paths, i.e. the coastlines, rivers and streams. The distances along all such features can be measured by placing a thread at the starting point and carrying it along the line up to the end point. The thread is then stretched and measured to determine the distance. It can also be measured by using a simple instrument called Rotameter.",

The line pointing to the north is zero direction or the base direction line. A map always shows the north direction. All other directions are determined in to this relation. The north direction enables the mapuser to locate different features with respect to each other. The four commonly known directions are North, South, East and West. These are also called the cardinal points. In between the cardinal points, one may have several intermediate directions (Fig. 1.14).\n\nMeasurement of Area: The measurement of area of features like that of administrative and geographic units is also carried out over the surface of the map by map-users. There are different methods in which areas can be determined. One of the simplest but not very accurate method to determine the area is by means of regular pattern of squares. In this method, the area to be measured is covered by squares by placing a sheet of graph paper beneath the map on an illuminated tracing table or by tracing the area onto the square sheet. The total number of 'whole squares' are summed up, together with 'partial squares'. The area is then determined by a simple equation:\nArea $=$ Sum of whole squares $+\\left(\\frac{\\text { Sum of partial squares }}{2}\\right) \\times$ Map Scale\nThe area can also be calculated by using a fixed area polar planimeter (Box 1.1).",

It is so important that if a network of lines and polygons does not carry a scale, we call it a \"sketch\". Why is the scale so important? What does it mean? What are the different methods of showing the scale on a map? How useful is the scale in measuring the distances and the area? These are some of the questions which will be taken up in the present chapter.\n\n## Glossary\n\nDenominator: The number below the line in a fraction. For example, in a fraction of $1: 50,000,50,000$ is the denominator.\n\nNumerator: The number above the line in a fraction. For example, in a fraction of $1: 50,000,1$ is the numerator.\n\nRepresentative Fraction: A method of scale of a map or plan expressed as a fraction showing the ratio between a unit distance on the map or plan, and the distance measured in the same units on the ground.\n\n## What is Scale ?\n\nYou must have seen maps with a scale bar indicating equal divisions, each marked with readings in kilometres or miles. These divisions are used to find out the ground distance on the map. In other words, a map scale provides the relationship between the map and the whole or a part of the earth's surface shown on it. We can also express this relationship as a ratio of distances between two points on the map and the corresponding distance between the same two points on the ground.",

But before taking up these issues, let us understand that the scale is normally expressed in one or the other system of measurement. You must have read and/or used kilometre, metre, centimetre etc. to measure the linear distances between two points on the ground. You might have also heard of miles, furlongs, yards, feet, etc. These are two different systems of measurement of the distances used in different countries of the world. Whereas the former system is referred to as the Metric System of Measurement and presently used in India and many other countries of the world, the latter system is known as the English System of Measurement and is prevalent in both the United States and the United Kingdom. India also used this system for measuring/showing linear distances before 1957. The units of measurement of these systems are given in Box 2.1.\n\n# Methods of Scale \n\nAs mentioned above, the scale of the map may be expressed using one or a combination of more than one methods of scale.

      "content": "1. Statement of Scale: The scale of a map may be indicated in the form of a written statement. For example, if on a map a written statement appears stating 1 cm represents 10 km , it means that on that map a distance of 1 cm is representing 10 km of the corresponding ground distance. It may also be expressed in any other system of measurement, i.e. 1 inch represents 10 miles. It is the simplest of the three methods. However, it may be noted that the people who are familiar with one system may not understand the statement of scale given in another system of measurement. Another limitation of this method is that if the map is reduced or enlarged, the scale will become redundant and a new scale is to be worked out.\n2. Graphical or Bar Scale: The second type of scale shows map distances and the corresponding ground distances using a line bar with primary and secondary divisions marked on it. This is referred to as the graphical scale or bar scale (Fig. 2.1). It may be noted that the scale readings as shown on the bar scale in Figure 2.1 reads only in kilometres and metres. In yet another bar scale the readings may be shown in miles and furlongs. Hence, like the statement of scale method, this method also finds restricted use for only those who can understand it. However, unlike the statement of the scale method, the graphical scale stands valid even when the map is reduced or enlarged. This is the unique advantage of the graphical method of the map scale.\n\n\n**[IMAGE: A diagram illustrating the scale of 1:50,000 with distance measurements in meters and kilometers.]**\n\n\n3. Representative Fraction (R. F. ): The third type of scale is R. F. It shows the relationship between the map distance and the corresponding ground distance in units of length. The use of units to express the scale makes it the most versatile method.\nR. F. is generally shown in fraction because it shows how much the real world is reduced to fit on the map. For example, a fraction of 1 : 24,000 shows that one unit of length on the map represents 24,000 of the same units on the ground i.e. one mm , one cm or one inch",

It may, however, be noted that while converting the fraction of units into Metric or English systems, units in centimetre or inch are normally used by convention. This quality of expressing scale in units in R. F. makes it a universally acceptable and usable method. Let us take R. F. of $1: 36,000$ to elaborate the universal nature of R. F.\n\nIf the given scale is $1: 36,000$, a person acquainted with the Metric System will read the given units by converting them into cm, i.e. the distance of 1 unit on the map as 1 cm and the distance of 36,000 units on the ground distance as $36,000 \\mathrm{~cm}$. These values may subsequently be converted into a statement of scale, i.e. 1 cm represents 360 metres. (by dividing values in denominator by the number of centimetres in a metre, i.e. 100). Yet another user of the map familiar with the English system of measurement will understand the map scale by converting it into a statement of scale convenient to him/her and read the map scale as 1 inch represents 1,000 yards. The said statement of scale will be obtained by dividing 36,000 units in the denominator by 36 (number of inches in a yard).\n\n# Conversion of Scale \n\nIf you have carefully read the advantages and limitations of the different methods of scale, then it will not be difficult for you to convert the Statement of Scale into Representative Fraction and vice-versa.\n\n## Statement of Scale into R.

To do so we can use the following procedure:\n\n* Draw a straight line of 6.3 inches.\n* Draw lines at an angle of $40^{\\circ}$ or $45^{\\circ}$ from the start and end nodes of the lines and divide them into 5 equal parts of 1 or 1.5 inches each.\n* Draw dotted lines joining the divisions marked on the two lines.\n* Mark the intersections of these lines at the primary scale.\n\nBy doing so, you will divide the unequal line of 6.3 inches into 5 equal parts.

      "content": "# Chapter 3 \n\n## Latitude, Longitude and Time\n\nTHE EARTH is nearly a sphere. It is because of the fact that the equatorial radius and the polar radius of the earth is not the same. The rotation of the earth over its axis produces bulging at the equator. Hence, the actual shape resembles that of an oblate spheroid. The shape of the earth presents some difficulties in positioning its surface features, as there is no point of reference from which to measure the relative positions of other points. Hence, a network of imaginary lines is drawn on a globe or a map to locate various places. Let us find out what are these lines and how are they drawn.\n\nThe spinning of the earth on its axis from west to east provides two natural points of reference, i.e. North and South Poles. They form the basis for the geographical grid. A network of intersecting lines is drawn for the purpose of fixing the locations of different features. The grid consists of two sets of horizontal and vertical lines, which are called parallels of latitudes and the meridians of longitudes.\n\nHorizontal lines are drawn parallel to each other in east-west direction. The line drawn midway between the North Pole and the South Pole is called the equator. It is the largest circle and divides the globe into two equal halves. It is also called a great circle. All the other parallels get smaller in size, in proportion to their distance from the equator towards the poles and divide the earth into two unequal halves, also referred to as the small circles. These imaginary lines running east-west are commonly known as the parallels of latitude.\n\nThe vertical lines running north-south, join the two poles. They are called the meridians of longitude. They are spaced farthest apart at the equator and converge at a point at each pole.",

      "content": "The latitudes and longitudes are commonly referred to as geographical coordinates as they provide systematic network of lines upon which the position of various surface features of the earth, can be represented. With the help of these coordinates, location, distance and direction of various points can be easily determined.\nAlthough an infinite number of parallels and meridians may be drawn on a globe, only a selected number of them are usually drawn on a map. Latitudes and longitudes are measured in degrees $\\left({ }^{\\circ}\\right)$ because they represent angular distances. Each degree is further divided into 60 minutes (') and each minute into 60 seconds (\").\n\n# Glossary \n\nParallels of Latitude : The parallels of latitude refer to the angular distance, in degrees, minutes and seconds of a point north or south of the Equator. Lines of latitude are often referred to as parallels.\n\nMeridians of Longitude : The meridians of longitude refer to the angular distance, in degrees, minutes, and seconds, of a point east or west of the Prime (Greenwich) Meridian. Lines of longitude are often referred to as meridians.\n\n## Parallels of Latitudes\n\nThe latitude of a place on the earth's surface is its distance north or south of the equator, measured along the meridian of that place as an angle from the centre of the earth. Lines joining places with the same latitudes are called parallels. The value of equator is $0^{\\circ}$ and the latitude of the poles are $90^{\\circ} \\mathrm{N}$ and $90^{\\circ} \\mathrm{S}$ (Fig. 3.1 on the next page). If parallels of latitude are drawn at an interval of one degree, there will be 89 parallels in the northern and the southern hemispheres each. The total number of parallels thus drawn, including the equator, will be 179. Depending upon the location of a feature or a place north or south of the equator, the letter N or S is written along with the value of the latitude.\n\nIf the earth were a perfect sphere, the length of $1^{0}$ of latitude (a one degree arc of a meridian) would be a constant value, i.e. 111 km everywhere on the earth. This length is almost the same as that of a",

But to be precise, a degree of latitude changes slightly in length from the equator to the poles. While at the equator, it is 110.6 km at the poles, it is 111.7 km . Latitude of a place may be determined with the help of the altitude of the sun or the Pole Star.\n\n## Drawing The Parallels Of Latitudes\n\nHow to draw the parallels of latitudes? Draw a circle and divide it into two equal halves by drawing a horizontal line in the centre. This represents the equator. Place a protractor on this circle in a way that $0^{\\circ}$ and $180^{\\circ}$ line on the protractor coincide with the equator on the paper. Now to draw $20^{\\circ} \\mathrm{S}$, mark two points at an angle of $20^{\\circ}$ from the equator, east and west in the lower half of the circle, as shown in Fig. 3.2. The arms of the angle cut the circle at two points. Join these two points by a line parallel to the equator. It will be $20^{\\circ} \\mathrm{S}$.\n\n## Meridians of Longitude\n\nUnlike the parallels of latitude which are circles, the meridians of longitude are semi-circles that converge at the poles. If opposite meridians are taken together, they complete a circle, but, they are valued separately as two meridians.\n\nThe meridians intersect the equator at right angles. Unlike the parallels of latitude, they are all equal in length. For convenience of numbering, the meridian of longitude passing through the Greenwich observatory (near London) has been adopted as the Prime Meridian by an international agreement and has been given the value of $0^{\\circ}$.\n\nThe longitude of a place is its angular distance east or west of the Prime Meridian. It is also measured in degrees. The longitudes vary from $0^{\\circ}$ to $180^{\\circ}$",

The part of the earth east of the Prime Meridian is called the eastern hemisphere and in its west referred to as the western hemisphere.\n\n## Drawing the Meridians of Longitude\n\nHow to draw the lines of longitude? Draw a circle whose centre represents the North Pole. The circumference will represent the equator. Draw a vertical line through the centre of the circle, i.e. crossing the North Pole. This represents the 0° and 180° meridians, which meet at the North Pole (Fig. 3.4).\n\nWhen you look at a map, the east is towards your right and the west is towards your left. However, to draw a longitude, imagine that you are on the North Pole, i.e. at the centre of the circle as shown in Fig. 3.4. Observe now that the relative directions of east and west would reverse in this case and east would be towards your left while west would be towards your right. Now, draw 45° E and W as shown in Fig. 3.5. For this, place your protractor along the vertical line, coinciding with the 0° and 180° meridians and then measure 45° on both the sides, which will denote 45° E meridian and 45° W meridian on your left and right, respectively. The diagram will represent the appearance of the earth if we look at it from directly above the North Pole.\n\n## Longitude and Time\n\nWe all know that the earth rotates from west to east over its axis. It makes the sun rise in the east and set in the west. The rotation of the earth over its axis takes 24 hours to complete one circle or 360° of longitudes. As 180° of longitudes fall both east and west of the Prime Meridian, the sun, thus takes 12 hours' time to traverse the\n\n\n\n**[IMAGE: A diagram showing the Prime Meridian and other meridians on a globe, with labels indicating degrees east and west of Greenwich, England.]**\n\n\n\n*Figure 3.3 Meridians of Longitude*\n\n\n\n**[IMAGE: A diagram showing the Earth's North Pole and the 0° and 180° lines of longitude.]**\n\n\n\n*Figure 3.4 Meridians of 0° and 180° join at the North Pole*\n\n\n\n**[IMAGE: A diagram showing the North Pole with longitudinal lines at 0°, 45° E, 45° W, and 180°.]**\n\n\n\n*Figure 3.5 Drawing of Meridians of Longitude*",

It may further be noted that the time decreases when we move from west to east and increases with our westward movement.\nThe rate of the time at which the sun traverses over certain degrees of longitudes is used to determine the local time of an area with respect to the time at the Prime Meridian ( $0^{\\circ}$ Longitude). Let us try to understand the question of the determination of time with respect to the Prime Meridian with the following set of examples :\n\nExample 1 : Determine the local time of Thimpu (Bhutan) located at $90^{\\circ}$ east longitude when the time at Greenwich $\\left(0^{\\circ}\\right)$ is 12.00 noon.\nStatement: The time increases at a rate of 4 minutes per one degree of longitude, east of the Prime Meridian.\n\n# Solution : \n\nDifference between Greenwich and Thimpu $=90^{\\circ}$ of longitudes\nTotal Time difference $=90 \\times 4=360$ minutes\n$=360 / 60$ hours\n$=6$ hours $\\backslash$ Local time of Thimpu is 6 hours more than that at Greenwich, i.e. 6.00 p.m.\n\nExample 2 : Determine the local time of New Orleans (the place, which was worst affected by Katrina Hurricane in October 2005), located at $90^{\\circ}$ West longitude when the time at Greenwich $\\left(0^{\\circ}\\right)$ is 12.00 noon.\nStatement: The time decrease, at a rate of 4 minutes per one degree of longitude, west of the prime meridian.\n\n## Solution :\n\nDifference between Greenwich and New Orleans $=90^{\\circ}$ of longitudes\nTotal Time difference $=90 \\times 4=360$ minutes\n$=360 / 60$ hours\n$=6$ hours $\\backslash$ Local time of New Orleans is 6 hours less than that at Greenwich, i.e. 6.00 a. m.\n\nIn the same way, the time may be determined for any place in the world. However, in order to maintain uniformity of time as far as possible within the territorial limits of a country, the time at the central meridian of the country is taken as the Standard Meridian and its local time is taken as the standard time for the whole country.

It can also be defined as the transformation of spherical network of parallels and meridians on a plane surface. As you know that, the earth on which we live in is not flat. It is geoid in shape like a sphere. A globe is the best model of the earth. Due to this property of the globe, the shape and sizes of the continents and oceans are accurately shown on it. It also shows the directions and distances very accurately. The globe is divided into various segments by the lines of latitude and longitude. The horizontal lines represent the parallels of latitude and the vertical lines represent the meridians of the longitude. The network of parallels and meridians is called graticule. This network facilitates drawing of maps. Drawing of the graticule on a flat surface is called projection.\n\nBut a globe has many limitations. It is expensive. It can neither be carried everywhere easily nor can a minor detail be shown on it. Besides, on the globe the meridians are semi-circles and the parallels are circles. When they are transferred on a plane surface, they become intersecting straight lines or curved lines.",

      "content": "# Need for Map Projection \n\nThe need for a map projection mainly arises to have a detailed study of a region, which is not possible to do from a globe. Similarly, it is not easy to compare two natural regions on a globe. Therefore, drawing accurate large-scale maps on a flat paper is required. Now, the problem is how to transfer these lines of latitude and longitude on a flat sheet. If we stick a flat paper over the globe, it will not coincide with it over a large surface without being distorted. If we throw light from the centre of the globe, we get a distorted picture of the globe in those parts of paper away from the line or point over which it touches the globe. The distortion increases with increase in distance from the tangential point. So, tracing all the properties like shape, size and directions, etc. from a globe is nearly impossible because the globe is not a developable surface.\n\nIn map projection we try to represent a good model of any part of the earth in its true shape and dimension. But distortion in some form or the other is inevitable. To avoid this distortion, various methods have been devised and many types of projections are drawn. Due to this reason, map projection is also defined as the study of different methods which have been tried for transferring the lines of graticule from the globe to a flat sheet of paper.\n\n## Glossary\n\nMap projection: It is the system of transformation of the spherical surface onto a plane surface. It is carried out by an orderly and systematic representation of the parallels of latitude and the meridians of longitude of the spherical earth or part of it on a plane surface on a conveniently chosen scale.\nLexodrome or Rhumb Line: It is a straight line drawn on Mercator's projection joining any two points having a constant bearing. It is very useful in determining the directions during navigation.\nThe Great Circle: It represents the shortest route between two points, which is often used both in air and ocean navigation.\nHomolograhic Projection: A projection in which the network of latitudes and longitudes is developed in such a way that every graticule on the map is equal in area to the corresponding graticule on the globe. It is also known as the equal-area projection.\nOrthomorphic Projection: A projection in which the correct shape of a given area of the earth's surface is preserved.",

This model is called the \"reduced earth\". This model should be more or less spheroid having the length of polar diameter lesser than equatorial and on this model the network of graticule can be transferred.\nb. Parallels of Latitude: These are the circles running round the globe parallel to the equator and maintaining uniform distance from the poles. Each parallel lies wholly in its plane which is at right angle to the axis of the earth. They are not of equal length. They range from a point at each pole to the circumference of the globe at the equator. They are demarcated as $0^{\\circ}$ to $90^{\\circ}$ North and South latitudes.\nc. Meridians of Longitude: These are semi-circles drawn in northsouth direction from one pole to the other, and the two opposite meridians make a complete circle, i.e. circumference of the globe. Each meridian lies wholly in its plane, but all intersect at right angle along the axis of the globe. There is no obvious central meridian but for convenience, an arbitrary choice is made, namely the meridian of Greenwich, which is demarcated as $0^{\\circ}$ longitudes. It is used as reference longitudes to draw all other longitudes\nd. Global Property: In preparing a map projection the following basic properties of the global surface are to be preserved by using one or the other methods:\n(i) Distance between any given points of a region;\n(ii) Shape of the region;\n(iii) Size or area of the region in accuracy;\n(iv) Direction of any one point of the region bearing to another point.\n\n## Classification of Map Projections\n\nMap Projections may be classified on the following bases:\na.

Perspective projections can be drawn taking the help of a source of light by projecting the image of a network of parallels and meridians of a globe on developable surface.

Mathematical or conventional projections are those, which are derived by mathematical computation, and formulae and have little relations with the projected image.\nb. Developable Surface: A developable surface is one, which can be flattened, and on which, a network of latitude and longitude can be projected. A non-developable surface is one, which cannot be flattened without shrinking, breaking or creasing. A globe or spherical surface has the property of non-developable surface whereas a cylinder, a cone and a plane have the property of developable surface.

A Conical projection is drawn by wrapping a cone round the globe and the shadow of graticule network is projected on it. When the cone is cut open, a projection is obtained on a flat sheet. Zenithal projection is directly obtained on a plane surface when plane touches the globe at a point and the graticule is projected on it. Generally, the plane is so placed on the globe that it touches the globe at one of the poles. These projections are further subdivided into normal, oblique or polar as per the position of the plane touching the globe.

Global Properties: As mentioned above, the correctness of area, shape, direction and distances are the four major global properties to be preserved in a map. But none of the projections can maintain all these properties simultaneously. Therefore, according to specific need, a projection can be drawn so that the desired quality may be retained. Thus, on the basis of global properties, projections are classified into equal area, orthomorphic, azimuthal and equi-distant projections. Equal Area Projection is also called homolographic projection. It is that projection in which areas of various parts of the earth are represented correctly. Orthomorphic or True-Shape projection is one in which shapes of various areas are portrayed correctly. The shape is generally maintained at the cost of the correctness of area. Azimuthal or True-Bearing projection is one on which the direction of all points from the centre is correctly represented. Equi-distant or True Scale projection is that where the distance or scale is correctly maintained. However, there is no such projection, which maintains the scale correctly throughout. It can be",

Source of Light: On the basis of location of source of light, projections may be classified as gnomonic, stereographic and orthographic. Gnomonic projection is obtained by putting the light at the centre of the globe. Stereographic projection is drawn when the source of light is placed at the periphery of the globe at a point diametrically opposite to the point at which the plane surface touches the globe. Orthographic projection is drawn when the source of light is placed at infinity from the globe, opposite to the point at which the plane surface touches the globe.\n\n# Constructing Some Selected Projections \n\n## a. Conical Projection with one Standard Parallel\n\nA conical projection is one, which is drawn by projecting the image of the graticule of a globe on a developable cone, which touches the globe along a parallel of latitude called the standard parallel. As the cone touches the globe located along $A B$, the position of this parallel on the globe coinciding with that on the cone is taken as the standard parallel. The length of other parallels on either side of this parallel are distorted.

Even within the hemisphere, it is not suitable for representing larger areas as the distortion along the pole and near the equator is larger.\n\n## Uses\n\n1. This projection is commonly used for showing areas of mid-latitudes with limited latitudinal and larger longitudinal extent.\n2. A long narrow strip of land running parallel to the standard parallel and having east-west stretch is correctly shown on this projection.\n3. Direction along standard parallel is used to show railways, roads, narrow river valleys and international boundaries.\n4. This projection is suitable for showing the Canadian Pacific Railways, Trans-Siberian Railways, international boundaries between USA and Canada and the Narmada Valley.\n\n## b. Cylindrical Equal Area Projection\n\nThe cylindrical equal area projection, also known as the Lambert's projection, has been derived by projecting the surface of the globe with parallel rays on a cylinder touching it at the equator. Both the parallels and meridians are projected as straight lines intersecting one another at right angles. The pole is shown with a parallel equal to the equator; hence, the shape of the area gets highly distorted at the higher latitude.\n\n## Example\n\nConstruct a cylindrical equal area projection for the world when the R.F. of the map is $1: 300,000,000$ taking latitudinal and longitudinal interval as $15^{\\circ}$.\n\n## Calculation\n\nRadius of the reduced earth $R=\\frac{640,000,000}{300,000,000}=2.1 \\mathrm{~cm}$\n\nLength of the equator $2 \\pi R$ or $\\frac{2 \\times 22 \\times 2.1}{7}=13.2 \\mathrm{~cm}$\n\nInterval along the equator $=\\frac{13.2 \\times 15^{\\circ}}{360^{\\circ}}=0.55 \\mathrm{~cm}$",

So, it is an orthomorphic projection in which the correct shape is maintained. The distance between parallels increases towards the pole. Like cylindrical projection, the parallels and meridians intersect each other at right angle. It has the characteristics of showing correct directions. A straight line joining any two points on this projection gives a constant bearing, which is called a Laxodrome or Rhumb line.\n\n## Example\n\nDraw a Mercator's projection for the world map on the scale of $1: 250,000,000$ at $15^{\\circ}$ interval.\n\n## Calculation\n\nRadius of the reduced earth is $R=\\frac{250,000,000}{250,000,000}=1^{\\circ}$ inch\n\nLength of the equator $2 \\pi \\mathrm{R}$ or $\\frac{1 \\times 22 \\times 2}{7}=6.28$ \"inches\n\nInterval along the equator $=\\frac{6.28 \\times 15^{\\circ}}{360^{\\circ}}=0.26$ \"inches\n\n## Construction\n\n(i) Draw a line of 6.28 \" inches representing the equator as EQ:\n(ii) Divide it into 24 equal parts. Determine the length of each division using the following formula:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\text { Length of Equator } \\times \\text { interval }}{360}\n$$\n\n(iii) Calculate the distance for latitude with the help of the table given below:-\n\n| Latitude | Distance |\n| :-- | :-- |\n| $15^{\\circ}$ | $0.265 \\times 1=0.265^{\\prime \\prime}$ inch |\n| $30^{\\circ}$ | $0.549 \\times 1=0.549^{\\prime \\prime}$ inch |\n| $45^{\\circ}$ | $0.881 \\times 1=0.881^{\\prime \\prime}$ inch |\n| $60^{\\circ}$ | $1.317 \\times 1=1.317^{\\prime \\prime}$ inches |\n| $75^{\\circ}$ | $2.027 \\times 1=2.027^{\\prime \\prime}$ inches |\n\n(iv) Complete the projection as shown in Fig. 4.5",

The topographical maps, which have been referred to in Chapter 1 are of utmost importance to geographers. They serve the purpose of base maps and are used to draw all the other maps.\n\nTopographical maps, also known as general purpose maps, are drawn at relatively large scales. These maps show important natural and cultural features such as relief, vegetation, water bodies, cultivated land, settlements, and transportation networks, etc. These maps are prepared and published by the National Mapping Organisation of each country. For example, the Survey of India prepares the topographical maps in India for the entire country. The topographical maps are drawn in the form of series of maps at different scales. Hence, in the given series, all maps employ the same reference point, scale, projection, conventional signs, symbols and colours.\n\nThe topographical maps in India are prepared in two series, i.e. India and Adjacent Countries Series and The International Map Series of the World.\n\nIndia and Adjacent Countries Series: Topographical maps under India and Adjacent Countries Series were prepared by the Survey of India till the coming into existence of Delhi Survey Conference in 1937. Henceforth, the preparation of maps for the adjoining countries was abandoned and the Survey of India confined itself to prepare and publish the topographical maps for India as per the specifications laid down for the International Map Series of the World. However, the Survey of India for the topographical maps",

They are also called \"level lines\".\nContour Interval: Interval between two successive contours. It is also known as vertical interval, usually written as V. I. Generally, it is constant for a given map.\nCross-section: A side view of the ground cut vertically along a straight line. It is also known as a section or profile.\nHachures: Small straight lines drawn on the map along the direction of maximum slope, running across the contours. They given an idea about the differences in the slope of the ground.\nTopographic Map: A map of a small area drawn on a large scale depicting detailed surface features both natural and man made. Relief in this map is shown by contours.\nunder the new series retained the numbering system and the layout plan of the abandoned India and Adjacent Countries Series.\n\nThe topographical maps of India are prepared on $1: 10,00,000$, $1: 250,000,1: 1,25,000,1: 50,000$ and $1: 25,000$ scale providing a latitudinal and longitudinal coverage of $4^{\\circ} \\times 4^{\\circ}, 1^{\\circ} \\times 1^{\\circ}, 30^{\\prime} \\times 30^{\\prime}$, $15^{\\prime} \\times 15^{\\prime}$ and $5^{\\prime} \\times 7^{\\prime} 30^{\\prime \\prime}$, respectively. The numbering system of each one of these topographical maps is shown in Fig. 5.1 (on page 51).\n\nInternational Map Series of the World: Topographical Maps under International Map Series of the World are designed to produce standardised maps for the entire World on a scale of 1: 10,00,000 and $1: 250,000$.\n\nReading of Topographical Maps: The study of topographical maps is simple. It requires the reader to get acquainted with the legend, conventional sign and the colours shown on the sheets. The conventional sign and symbols depicted on the topographical sheets are shown in Fig. 5.2 (on page 52).\n\n## Methods of Relief Representation\n\nThe earth's surface is not uniform and it varies from mountains to hills to plateaus and plains. The elevation and depressions of the earth's surface are known as physical features or relief features of the earth. The map showing these features is called a relief map.",

      "content": "# Contours \n\nContours are imaginary lines joining places having the same elevation above mean sea level. A map showing the landform of an area by contours is called a contour map. The method of showing relief features through contour is very useful and versatile. The contour lines on a map provide a useful insight into the topography of an area.\n\nEarlier, ground surveys and levelling methods were used to draw contours on topographical maps. However, the invention of photography and subsequent use of aerial photography have replaced the conventional methods of surveying, levelling and mapping. Henceforth, these photographs are used in topographical mapping.\n\nContours are drawn at different vertical intervals (VI), like 20, 50, 100 metres above the mean sea level. It is known as contour interval. It is usually constant on a given map. It is generally expressed in metres. While the vertical interval between the two successive contour lines remains constant, the horizontal distance varies from place to place depending upon the nature of slope. The horizontal distance, also known as the horizontal equivalent (HE), is large when the slope is gentler and decreases with increasing slope gradient.\n\n## Some basic features of contour lines are\n\n- A contour line is drawn to show places of equal heights.\n- Contour lines and their shapes represent the height and slope or gradient of the landform.\n- Closely spaced contours represent steep slopes while widely spaced contours represent gentle slope.\n- When two or more contour lines merge with each other, they represent features of vertical slopes such as cliffs or waterfalls.\n- Two contours of different elevation usually do not cross each other.\n\n\n## Drawing of Contours and Their Cross Sections\n\nWe know that all the topographical features show varying degrees of slopes. For example, a flat plain exhibits gentler slopes and the cliffs and gorges are associated with the steep slopes. Similarly, valleys and mountain ranges are also characterised by the varying degree of slopes, i.e. steep to gentle. Hence, the spacing of contours is significant since it indicates the slope.",

Draw a straight line cutting across the contours on the map and mark it as $A B$.\n2. Take a strip of white paper or graph and place its edge along the AB line.\n3. Mark the position and value of every contour that cuts the line AB.\n4. Choose a suitable vertical scale, eg $1 / 2 \\mathrm{~cm}=100$ metres, to draw horizontal lines parallel to each other and equal to the length of AB . The number of such lines should be equal or more than the total contour lines.\n5. Mark the appropriate values corresponding to the contour values along the vertical of the cross-section. The numbering may be started with the lowest value represented by the contours.\n6. Now place the edge of the marked paper along the horizontal line at the bottom line of the cross-section in such a way that $A B$ of the paper corresponds to the $A B$ of the map and mark the contour points.\n7. Draw perpendiculars from $A B$ line, intersecting contour lines, to the corresponding line at the cross-section base.\n8. Smoothly join all the points marked on different lines at the crosssection base.\n\n## Identification of Cultural Features From Topographical Sheets\n\nSettlements, buildings, roads and railways are important cultural features shown on topographical sheets through conventional signs, symbols and colours. The location and pattern of distribution of different features help in understanding the area shown on the map.\n\n## Distribution Of Settlements\n\nIt can be seen in the map through its site, location pattern, alignment and density. The nature and causes of various settlement patterns may be clearly understood by comparing the settlement map with the contour map.",

For example, in rural areas the main occupation of majority of the people is agriculture; in tribal regions, lumbering and primitive agriculture dominates and in coastal areas, fishing is practised. Similarly, in cities and towns, services and business appear to be the major occupations of the people.\n\n# Map Interpretation Procedure \n\nMap interpretation involves the study of factors that explain the causal relationship among several features shown on the map. For example, the distribution of natural vegetation and cultivated land can be better understood against the background of landform and drainage. Likewise, the distribution of settlements can be examined in association with the levels of transport network system and the nature of topography.\n\nThe following steps will help in map interpretation:\n\n- Find out from the index number of the topographical sheet, the location of the area in India. This would give an idea of the general characteristics of the major and minor physiographic divisions of the area. Note the scale of the map and the contour interval, which will give the extent and general landform of the area.",

The present day remote sensing devices, on the other hand, react to much wider range of radiations reflected/ emitted, absorbed and transmitted by all object surfaces at a temperature above 0 Kelvin (-273 C).\n\nThe term remote sensing was first used in the early 1960s. Later, it was defined as the total processes used to acquire and measure the information of some property of objects and phenomena by a recording device (sensor) that is not in physical contact with the objects and phenomena in study. It can be noted from the above definition of remote sensing that it primarily involves an object surface, the recording device and the information carrying energy waves (Fig 6.1).\n\n\n**[IMAGE: An image depicting a natural sensor with information-carrying energy waves.]**\n\n\n\nNATURAL SENSOR\n\n\n**[IMAGE: A photograph of a historical building surrounded by greenery and palm trees.]**\n\n\n\nFigure 6.1 Conceptual Frame of Remote Sensing",

On the basis of the size of the waves and frequency, the energy waves are grouped into Gamma, Xrays, Ultraviolet rays, Visible rays, Infrared rays, Microwaves and Radio waves.

Interaction of Energy with the Earth's Surface: The propagating energy finally interacts with the objects of the surface of the earth. This leads to absorption, transmission, reflection or emission of energy from the objects. We all know that all objects vary in their composition, appearance forms and other properties. Hence, the objects' responses to the energy they receive are also not uniform. Besides, one particular object also responds differently to the energy it receives in different regions of the spectrum (Fig. 6.5). For example, a fresh water body absorbs more energy in the red and infrared regions of the spectrum and appears dark/black in a satellite image whereas turbid water body reflects more in blue and green regions of spectrum and appears in light tone (Fig. 6.4).",

However, the sensors used in remote sensing satellites possess a mechanism that is different from photographic camera in collecting and recording the information. The images so acquired by space-borne sensors are in digital format as against the photographic format obtained through a camera-based system.\n\n# f. Conversion of Energy Received into Photographic/ Digital Form of Data: The radiations received by the sensor are electronically converted into a digital image. It comprises digital numbers that are arranged in rows and columns. These numbers may also be converted into an analogue (picture) form of data product. The sensor onboard an earth-orbiting satellite electronically transmits the collected image data to an Earth Receiving Station located in different parts of the world. In India, one such station is located at Shadnagar near Hyderabad. \n\n## g. Extraction of Information Contents from Data\n\nProducts: After the image data is received at the earth station, it is processed for elimination of errors caused during image data collection. Once the image is corrected, information extraction is carried out from digital images using digital image processing techniques and from analogue form of data products by applying visual interpretation methods.\n\n## h. Conversion of Information into Map/Tabular Forms:\n\nThe interpreted information is finally delineated and converted into different layers of thematic maps. Besides, quantitative measures are also taken to generate a tabular data.\n\n## Sensors\n\nA sensor is a device that gathers electromagnetic radiations, converts it into a signal and presents it in a form suitable for obtaining information about the objects under investigation. Based upon the form of the data output, the sensors are classified into photographic (analogue) and non-photographic (digital) sensors.\n\nA photographic sensor (camera) records the images of the objects at an instance of exposure. On the other hand, a non-photographic sensor obtains the images of the objects in bit-by-bit form. These sensors are known as scanners. In the present chapter, we will confine ourselves to describe the non-photographic sensors that are used in satellite remote sensing.",

These sensors are designed to obtain images of the objects while sweeping across the field of view. A scanner is usually made up of a reception system consisting of a mirror and detectors. A scanning sensor constructs the scene by recording a series of scan lines. While doing so, the motor device oscillates the scanning mirror through the angular field of view of the sensor, which determines the length of scan lines and is called swath. It is because of such reasons that the mode of collection of images by scanners is referred bit-by-bit. Each scene is composed of cells that determine the spatial resolution of an image. The oscillation of the scanning mirror across the scene directs the received energy to the detectors, where it is converted into electrical signals. These signals are further converted into numerical values called Digital Number (DN Values) for recording on a magnetic tape.\n\nThe Multi-Spectral Scanners are divided into the following types:\n(i) Whiskbroom Scanners\n(ii) Pushbroom Scanners\n(i) Whiskbroom Scanners : The whiskbroom scanners are made up of a rotating mirror and a single detector.

The total extent of the oscillating sensor is known as the Total Field of View (TFOV) of the scanner. While scanning the entire field, the sensor's optical head is always placed at a particular dimension called the Instantaneous Field of View (IFOV). Figure 6.7 depicts the scanning mechanism of whiskbroom scanners.\n(i) Pushbroom Scanners: The pushbroom scanners consist of a number of detectors which are equivalent to the number obtained by dividing the swath of the sensor by the size of the spatial resolution (Fig. 6.8). For example, the swath of High Resolution Visible Radiometer - 1 (HRVR - 1) of the French remote sensing satellite SPOT is 60 km and the spatial resolution is 20 metres. If we divide $60 \\mathrm{~km} \\times 1000$ metres/20 metres, we get a number of 3000 detectors that are deployed in SPOT HRV - 1 sensor. In pushbroom scanner, all detectors are linearly arrayed and each detector collects the energy reflected by the ground cell (pixel) dimensions of 20 metres at a nadir's view.\n\n# Resolving Powers of the Satellites \n\nIn satellite remote sensing, the sun-synchronous polar orbit enables the collection of images after a pre-determined periodical interval referred to as the temporal resolution or the revisit time of the satellite over the same area of the earth surface. Fig. 6.9 illustrates the two images acquired over two different periods in time for the same area enabling to study and record the changes that take place with respect to the types of vegetation in Himalayas. In another example, Fig. 6.10 (a and b) shows the images acquired before and after the tsunami in the Indian Ocean. The image acquired in June 2004 clearly shows the undisturbed topography of Banda Aceh in Indonesia, whereas the post tsunami image acquired immediately after tsunami reveals the damages that were caused by the tsunami.",

      "content": "# Sensor Resolutions \n\nRemote sensors are characterised by spatial, spectral and radiometric resolutions that enable the extraction of useful information pertaining to different terrain conditions.\n(i) Spatial Resolution: You must have seen some people using spectacles while reading a book or newspaper. Have you ever thought as to why they do so. It is simply because of the fact that resolving power of their eyes to differentiate two closed spaced letters in a word is unable to identify them as two different letters. By using positive spectacles they try to improve their vision as well as the resolving power. In remote sensing, the spatial resolution of the sensors refers to the same phenomena. It is the capability of the sensor to distinguish two closed spaced object surfaces as two different object surfaces. As a rule, with an increasing resolution the identification of even smaller object surfaces become possible.\n(ii) Spectral Resolution: It refers to the sensing and recording power of the sensor in different bands of EMR (Electromagnetic radiation). Multispectral images are acquired by using a device that disperses the radiation received by the sensor and recording it by deploying detectors sensitive to specific spectral ranges. The principles in obtaining such images is the extension of the dispersion of light in nature resulting in the appearance of the 'rainbow\" and the use of prism in the lab (Box 6.2).\n\nThe images obtained in different bands show objects response differently as discussed in Para 3 of the stages in remote sensing data acquisition. Fig. 6.11 illustrates images acquired in different spectral regions by IRS P - 6 (Resource sat - 1) showing strong absorption properties of fresh water in band 4 (Infrared) and mixed strong reflectance in band 2 (green) by dry surfaces (Fig. 6.11).\n(iii) Radiometric Resolution: It is the capability of the sensor to discriminate between two targets. Higher the radiometric resolution, smaller the radiance differences that can be detected between two targets.\n\nThe spatial, spectral, and radiometric resolutions of some of the remote sensing satellites of the world are shown in Table 6.1.",

      "content": "# Data Products \n\nWe have seen that the electromagnetic energy may be detected either photographically or electronically. The photographic process uses light sensitive film to detect and record energy variations. On the other hand, a scanning device obtains images in digital mode. It is important to distinguish between the terms - images and photographs. An image refers to pictorial representation, regardless of what regions of energy have been used to detect and record it. A photograph refers specifically to images that have been recorded on photographic film. Hence, it can be said that all photographs are images, but all images are not photographs.\n\nBased upon the mechanism used in detecting and recording, the remotely sensed data products may be broadly classified into two types :\n\n* Photographic Images\n* Digital Images\n\nPhotographic Images: Photographs are acquired in the optical regions of electromagnetic spectrum, i.e. $0.3-0.9 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$. Four different types of light sensitive film emulsion bases are used to obtain photographs. These are black and white, colour, black and white infrared and colour infrared. However, in aerial photography black and white film is normally used. Photographs may be enlarged to any extent without loosing information contents or the contrast.\n\nDigital Images: A digital image consists of discrete picture elements called pixels. Each one of the pixels in an image has an intensity value and an address in two-dimensional image space. A digital number (DN) represents the average intensity value of a pixel. It is dependent upon the electromagnetic energy received by the sensor and the intensity levels used to describe its range.\n\nIn a digital image, the reproduction of the details pertaining to the images of the objects is affected by the size of the pixel. A smaller size pixel is generally useful in the preservation of the scene details and digital representation. However, zooming of the digital image beyond certain extent produces loss of information and the appearance of pixels only. Using a digital image processing algorithms, the digital numbers representing their intensity level in an image may be displayed (Fig. 6.12).",

      "content": "# Elements of Visual Interpretation \n\nWhether we are conscious of it or not we use the form, size, location of the objects and their relationships with the surrounding objects to identify them in our day-to-day life. These characteristics of objects are termed as elements of visual interpretation. We can further group the characteristics of the objects into two broad categories, i.e. image characteristics and terrain characteristics. The image characteristics include tone or colour in which objects appear, their shape, size, pattern, texture and the shadow they cast. On the other hand, location and the association of different objects with their surrounding objects constitute the terrain characteristics.\n\n1. Tone or Colour: We know that all objects receive energy in all regions of spectrum. The interaction of EMR with the object surface leads to the absorption, transmittance and reflection of energy. It is the reflected amount of the energy that is received and recorded by the sensor in tones of grey, or hues of colour in black and white, and colour images respectively. The variations in the tone or the colour depend upon the orientation of incoming radiations, surface properties and the composition of the objects. In other words, smooth and dry object surfaces reflect more energy in comparison to the rough and moist surfaces. Besides, the response of the objects also varies in different regions of the spectrum (Refer para 'C - Stages in remote sensing data acquisition'). For example, healthy vegetation reflects strongly in the infrared region because of the multiple-layered leaf structure and appears in a light tone or bright red\n\n\n**[IMAGE: A satellite image showing land use patterns and urban sprawl.]**\n\n\n6.13 (a) Turbid river\n\n\n**[IMAGE: Satellite image of a river and surrounding landscape.]**\n\n\n6.13 (b) River with fresh water",

These variations are primarily caused by an aggregation of smaller unit features that fail to be discerned individually such as high density and low density residential areas; slums and squatter settlements; garbage and other forms of solid waste; and different types of crops and plants. The textural differences in the images of certain objects vary from smooth to coarse textures (Fig. 6.14 a and b). For example, dense residential areas in a large city form fine texture due to the concentration of the houses in a smaller area and the low-density residential areas produce a coarse texture. Similarly, in high resolution images the sugarcane or millet plants produce coarse texture in comparison to the fine texture of rice or wheat plants. One can also notice the coarse texture in the images of scrubbed lands if compared with the fine texture of lush green evergreen forests.\n\n\n**[IMAGE: Satellite image of an island with dense vegetation.]**\n\n\n\nFigure 6.14 (a) Coarse texture image of mangroves\n\n\n**[IMAGE: A satellite image showing land use and land cover patterns.]**\n\n\n\nFigure 6.14 (b) Fine texture of cropped land\n3. Size: The size of an object as discerned from the resolution or scale of an image is another important characteristic of individual objects. It helps in distinctively identifying the industrial and industrial complexes with residential dwellings (Fig. 6.15), stadium in the heart of the city with the brick kilns at an urban fringe, size and hierarchy of the settlements, etc.\n4. Shape: The general form and configuration or an outline of an individual object provides important clues in the interpretation of remote sensing images. The shape of some of the objects is so distinctive that make them easy to identify. For example, the shape of the Sansad Bhawan is typically distinct from many other built-up features. Similarly, a railway line can be readily distinguished from a road due to its long continuous linearity in shape with gradual change in its course (Figure 6.16). The",

The shape of some of the objects is so typical that they could not be identified without finding out the length of the shadow they cast. For example, the Qutub Minar located in Delhi, minarets of mosques, overhead water tanks, electric or telephone lines, and similar features can only be identified using their shadow. Shadow also adversely affects the identifiability of the objects in city centres as it produces a dark tone, which dominates the original tone or colour of the features lying under the shadow of tall buildings. It may, however, be noted that the shadow as an element of image interpretation is of less use in satellite images. However, it serves a useful purpose in large-scale aerial photography.\n6.

For example, planned residential areas with the same size and layout plan of the dwelling units in an urban area can easily be identified if their pattern is followed (Figure 6.17). Similarly, orchards and plantations produce arrangements of the same type of plants with uniform inter plant distances. A distinction can also be made between various types of drainage or settlements if their pattern is properly studied and recognised.\n\n\n**[IMAGE: A satellite image showing different land cover types.]**\n\n\n\nFigure 6.17 Planned residential areas are easily identifiable using the pattern they form\n7. Association: The association refers to the relationship between the objects and their surroundings along with their geographical location. For example, an educational institution always finds its association with its location in or near a residential area as well as the location of a playground within the same premises. Similarly, stadium, race course and golf course holds good for a large city, industrial sites along highway at the periphery of a growing city, and slums along drains and railway lines.\n\nInternet sources for more information:\n\n- www.isro.gov.in\n- www.nrsc.gov.in\n- www.iirs.gov.in",
