INDIA'S POSITION ON CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n- India emitted 2,136.84 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent greenhouse gases in 2010.\n- Energy sector was the prime contributor to emissions and with $71 \\%$ of total emissions in 2010. Energy sector includes - electricity production, fuel combustion in industries, transport and fugitive emissions.\n- Industrial processes and product use contributed 8\\%; agriculture and waste sectors contributed $18 \\%$ and $3 \\%$ respectively to the national GHG inventory.\n- About $12 \\%$ of emissions were offset by carbon sink action of forests and croplands, considering which the national GHG emissions are arrived at a total of 1,884.31 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent.\n- India's per capita GHG emission in 2010 was 1.56 tCO2 equivalent, which is less than one- third of the world's per capita emissions and far below than many developed and developing countries.\n- A reduction of emission intensity of GDP by about $12 \\%$ between 2005 and 2010 has been achieved against our voluntary pledge to reduce the emission intensity of its GDP by 20-25 per cent by 2020, compared with the 2005 level.\n- India will continue to be a low-carbon economy (World Bank study).\n- India's primary focus is on \"adaptation\", with specific focus for \"mitigation\".\n- India has already unveiled a comprehensive National Action Plan on Climate Change whose activities are in the public domain.\n- India advocates collaborative research in future lowcarbon technology and access to intellectual property rights (IPRs) as global public goods.\n\n\n### 22.2. OBSERVED CLIMATE AND WEATHER CHANGES IN INDIA\n\n- India's National Communication (NATCOM) to UNFCCC has consolidated some of the observed changes in climate parameters in India. No firm link between the documented changes described below and warming due to anthropogenic climate change has yet been established.\n\n\n### 22.2.1. Surface Temperature\n\n- At the national level, increase of $-0.4^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ has been observed in surface air temperatures over the past century. A warming trend has been observed along the west coast, in central India, the interior peninsula, and north-eastern India. However, cooling trends have been observed in north-west India and parts of south India.\n\n\n### 22.2.2. Rainfall\n\n- While the observed monsoon rainfall at the all-India level does not show any significant trend, regional monsoon variations have been recorded.\n- A trend of increasing monsoon seasonal rainfall has been found along the west coast, northern Andhra Pradesh, and north-western India ( $+10 \\%$ to $+12 \\%$ of the normal over the last 100 years) while a trend of decreasing monsoon seasonal rainfall has been observed over eastern Madhya Pradesh, north-eastern India, and some parts of Gujarat and Kerala ( $-6 \\%$ to $-8 \\%$ of the normal over the last 100 years).\n\n\n### 22.2.3. Extreme Weather Events\n\n- Instrument records over the past 130 years do not indicate any marked long-term trend in the frequencies of large-scale droughts and floods. Trends are however observed in multi-decadal periods of more frequent droughts, followed by less severe droughts.",

    "content": "- There has been an overall increasing trend in severe storm incidence along the coast at the rate of 0.011 events per year. While the states of West Bengal and Gujarat have reported increasing trends, a decline has been observed in Orissa.\n\n\n### 22.2.4. Rise in Sea Level\n\n- The records of coastal tide gauges in the north Indian Ocean for more than 40 years, reports that sea level rise was between 1.06-1.75 mm per year. These rates are consistent with 1-2 mm per year global sea level rise estimates of IPCC.\n\n\n### 22.2.5. Impacts on Himalayan Glaciers\n\n- The Himalayas possess one of the largest resources of snow and ice and its glaciers form a source of water for the perennial rivers such as the Indus, the Ganga, and the Brahmaputra.\n- Glacial melt may impact their long-term lean-season flows, with adverse impacts on the economy in terms of water availability and hydropower generation.\n- The available monitoring data on Himalayan glaciers indicates that while recession of some glaciers has occurred in some Himalayan regions in recent years, the trend is not consistent across the entire mountain chain. It is accordingly, too early to establish long-term trends, or their causation, in respect of which there are several hypotheses.\n\n\n## Do you know?\n\nTripura is one of the highest CVP (Climate, Vegetation, Precipitation) index zones (a measure of potential productivity) in the country.\n\n### 22.3. CURRENT ACTIONS FOR ADAPTATION AND MITIGATION\n\n- Adaptation, in the context of climate change, comprises the measures taken to minimize the adverse impacts of climate change, e.g. relocating the communities living close to the sea shore, for instance, to cope with the rising sea level or switching to crops that can withstand higher temperatures.\n- Mitigation comprises measures to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases that cause climate change in the first place, e.g. by switching to renewable sources of energy such as solar energy or wind energy, or nuclear\nenergy instead of burning fossil fuel in thermal power stations.\n- Current Indian government expenditure on adaptation to climate variability, exceeds $2.6 \\%$ of the GDP, with agriculture, water resources, health and sanitation, forests, coastal-zone infrastructure and extreme weather events, being specific areas of concern.\n\n\n### 22.3.1. AGRICULTURE\n\n- Two risk-financing programmes support adaptation to climate impacts. The Crop Insurance Scheme sup-ports the insurance of farmers against climate risks, and the Credit Support Mechanism facilitates the extension of credit to farmers, especially for crop failure due to climate variability.\n\n\n### 22.3.2. CROP IMPROVEMENT\n\n- The present programmes address measures such as development of arid-land crops and pest management, as well as capacity building of extension workers and NGOs to support better vulnerability reducing practices.\n\n\n### 22.3.3. DROUGHT PROOFING\n\n- The current programmes seek to minimize the adverse effects of drought on production of crops and livestock, and on productivity of land, water and human resources, so as to ultimately lead to drought proofing of the affected areas.\n- They also aim to pro-mote overall economic development and improve the socio-economic conditions of the resource poor and disadvantaged sections inhabiting the programme areas.\n\n\n### 22.3.4. FORESTRY\n\n- India has a strong and rapidly growing afforestation programme. The afforestation process was accelerated by the enactment of the Forest Conservation Act of 1980, which aimed at stopping the clearing and degradation of forests through a strict, centralized control of the rights to use forest land and mandatory requirements of compensatory afforestation in case of any diversion of forest land for any non-forestry purpose.\n- In addition an aggressive afforestation and sustainable forest management programme resulted in annual reforestation of 1.78 mha during 1985-1997, and is currently 1.1 mha annually. Due to this, the carbon stocks in Indian forests have increased over the last 20 years (during 1986 to 2005) to 9 -10 gigatons of carbon (GtC).",

    "content": "### 22.3.5. WATER\n\n- The National Water Policy stresses that non-conventional methods for utilization of water, including interbasin transfers, artificial recharge of groundwater, and desalination of brackish or sea water, as well as traditional water conservation practices like rainwater harvesting, including roof-top rainwater harvesting, should be practised to increase the utilizable water resources. Many states now have mandatory water harvesting programmes in several cities.\n\n\n### 22.3.6. COASTAL REGIONS\n\n- In coastal regions, restrictions have been imposed in the area between 200 m and 500 m of the HTL (high tide line) while special restrictions have been imposed in the area up to 200 m to protect the sensitive coastal ecosystems and prevent their exploitation.\n- This, simultaneously, addresses the concerns of the coastal population and their livelihood. Some specific measures taken in this regard include construction of coastal protection infrastructure and cyclone shelters, as well as plantation of coastal forests and mangroves.\n\n\n### 22.3.7. HEALTH\n\n- The prime objective present of health programmes is the surveillance and control of vector borne diseases such as Malaria, Kala-azar, Japanese Encephalitis, Filaria and Dengue. Programmes also provide for emergency medical relief in the case of natural calamities, and to train and develop human resources for these tasks.\n\n\n### 22.3.8. DISASTER MANAGEMENT\n\n- The National Disaster Management programme provides grants-in-aid to victims of weather related disasters, and manages disaster relief operations. It also supports proactive disaster prevention programmes, including dissemination of information and training of disaster-management staff.\n\n\n## Do you know?\n\nA Chapter on Sustainable Development and Climate Change has been for the first time introduced in the annual Economic Survey. This new chapter reflects the growing challenges of sustainable development and climate change. Pressures on land, air, water, forests and loss of plant and animal habitant are growing.\n\n### 22.4. INDIA'S NATIONAL ACTION PLAN ON CLIMATE CHANGE\n\nIn dealing with the challenge of climate change we must act on several fronts in a focused manner simultaneously. The National Action Plan hinges on the development and use of new technologies. The implementation of the Plan would be through appropriate institutional mechanisms suited for effective delivery of each individual Mission's objectives and include public private partnerships and civil society action. The focus will be on promoting understanding of climate change, adaptation and mitigation, energy efficiency and natural resource conservation.\nThere are Eight National Missions which form the core of the National Action Plan, representing multipronged, longterm and integrated strategies for achieving key goals in the context of climate change.\n\n## Do you know?\n\nThe Economic Survey 2011-12, suggests to make lower carbon sustainable growth a central element of our Twelfth Five Year Plan commencing in April 2012. The Survey points out that India's per capita $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions are much lower ( $1.52 \\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ tons) than those of the developed countries even if historical emissions are excluded.\n\n### 22.4.1. NATIONAL SOLAR MISSION\n\n- The National Solar Mission is a major initiative of the Government of India and State Governments to promote ecologically sustainable growth while addressing India's energy security challenge.\n\n\n## Objective\n\n- To establish India as a global leader in solar energy, by creating the policy conditions for its diffusion across the country as quickly as possible.\n- The Mission will adopt a 3-phase approach,\n- spanning the remaining period of the 11th Plan and first year of the 12th Plan (up to 2012-13) as Phase 1,\n- the remaining 4 years of the 12th Plan (2013-17) as Phase 2 and\n- the 13th Plan (2017-22) as Phase 3.\n- At the end of each plan, and mid-term during the 12th and 13th Plans, there will be an evaluation of progress, review of capacity and targets for subsequent phases, based on emerging cost and technology trends, both domestic and global.",

Tropical rainforests arise due to the intertropical convergence zone. The largest tropical rainforests exist in the Amazon basin, Nicaragua, equatorial Africa, southeastern Asia from Myanmar to Indonesia, eastern Queensland and part of Australia.\nThe beneficial effects of rain forests are manifold. It is also called \"lungs of the world\" and act as major consumers of atmospheric carbon and play a large role in cooling air.\nIt is estimated that the rainforests were reduced by about $58,000 \\mathrm{~km}^{2}$ annually in the 1990s. Rainforests used to cover $14 \\%$ of the Earth's surface. This percentage is now down to $6 \\%$ and it is estimated by study that the remaining natural rainforests could disappear within 40 years.\n\n### 22.4.4. NATIONAL WATER MISSION (NWM)\n\n## MISSION OBJECTIVES\n\n- Ensuring integrated water resource management for conservation of water, minimization of wastage and equitable distribution both across and within states.\n- Developing a framework for optimum water use through increase in water use efficiency by $20 \\%$ through regulatory mechanisms with differential entitlements and pricing, taking the National Water Policy (NWP) into consideration.\n- Ensuring that a considerable share of water needs of urban areas is met through recycling of waste water.\n- Meeting water requirements of coastal cities (with inadequate alternative sources of water) through the adoption of new and appropriate technologies such as low-temperature desalination technologies allowing use of ocean water.\n- Revisiting NWP to ensure basin-level management strategies to deal with variability in rainfall and river flows due to climate change, including enhancement of storage both above and below ground, implementation of rainwater harvesting and establishment of equitable and efficient management structures.\n- Developing new regulatory structures to optimize efficiency of existing irrigation systems, to rehabilitate run-down systems and to expand irrigation to increase storage capacity.\n- Promotion of water-neutral and water-positive technologies through the design of a proper incentive structure combined with recharging of underground water sources and adoption of large-scale irrigation programme based on efficient methods of irrigation.\n\n\n## Do you know?\n\n1. The 2009 State of the Environment Report by the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) clubs the issues under five key main challenges faced by India, which are climate change, food, security, water security, energy security and managing urbanization.\n2.

A slew of policy measures to promote low carbon strategies and Renewable Energy have resulted in the decline of emission intensity of our GDP by $12 \\%$ between 2005 and 2010. It is a matter of satisfaction that United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) in its Emission Gap Report 2014 has recognized India as one of the countries on course to achieving its voluntary goal.\nINDC outlines the post-2020 climate actions they intend to take under a new international agreement. The INDC centre around India's policies and programmes on promotion of clean energy, especially renewable energy, enhancement of energy efficiency, development of less carbon intensive and resilient urban centres, promotion of waste to wealth, safe, smart and sustainable green transportation network, abatement of pollution and India's efforts to enhance carbon sink through creation of forest and tree cover. It also captures citizens and private sector contribution to combating climate change.\nThe INDC proposals are on the following:\na. Sustainable Lifestyles\nb. Cleaner Economic Development\nc. Reduce Emission intensity of Gross Domestic Product (GDP)\nd. Increase the Share of Non Fossil Fuel Based Electricity\ne. Enhancing Carbon Sink (Forests)\nf. Adaptation\ng. Mobilizing Finance\nh.

Some of the salient points of the INDC are:\n\n- To put forward and further propagate a healthy and sustainable way of living based on traditions and values of conservation and moderation.\n- To adopt a climate-friendly and a cleaner path than the one followed hitherto by others at corresponding level of economic development.\n- To reduce the emissions intensity of its GDP by 33 to 35 per cent by 2030 from 2005 level.\n- To achieve about 40 per cent cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel based energy resources by 2030, with the help of transfer of technology and low cost international finance, including from Green Climate Fund.\n- To create an additional carbon sink of 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes of CO 2 equivalent through additional forest and tree cover by 2030.\n- To better adapt to climate change by enhancing investments in development programmes in sectors vulnerable to climate change, particularly agriculture, water resources, Himalayan region, coastal regions, health and disaster management.\n- To mobilize domestic and new and additional funds from developed countries to implement the above mitigation and adaptation actions in view of the resource required and the resource gap.\n- To build capacities, create domestic framework and international architecture for quick diffusion of cutting edge climate technology in India and for joint collaborative R\\&D for such future technologies.\n\n\n### 22.6. INDIAN NETWORK ON CLIMATE CHANGE ASSESSMENT\n\n- The Indian Network on Climate Change Assessment (INCCA) was launched in October 2009 by the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) in an effort to promote domestic research on climate change, and build on the country's climate change expertise.\n- INCCA is a network-based programme of the MoEF, which consists of over 120 institutions and over 250 scientists country wide is aimed at bringing in more science-based policy-making, based on measurements, monitoring and modelling.\n- The INCCA has been conceptualized as a Network based Scientific Programme designed to address and assess the drivers and implications of climate change through scientific research; climate change assessments on various aspects of climate change, associated vulnerabilities and adaptation; devise decision support systems; and build capacity towards management of climate change related risks and opportunities.\n- The INCCA will carry out research on the effects of climate change in different regions and sectors in India and suggest suitable adaptation and mitigation steps.\n- Objective - to have an independent body of Indian scientists who could \"prepare scientific reports at the domestic level about the impact of climate change on various sectors, which can give a real picture and influence the world debate\".\n- Reports prepared by the INCCA will form a part of India's National Communication (Nat Com) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).\n\n\n### 22.6.1. INCCA - First Assessment 'India: Greenhouse Gas Emissions 2007'\n\n- The first publication to come out from the INCCA has been an updated greenhouse gas emissions inventory for India for the year 2007.\n- The first Assessment of the Green House Gas emissions was released on May 11, 2010.\n- INCCA prepared the country's greenhouse gas (GHG) emission data \"India: Greenhouse Gas Emissions 2007\" which said the country's emissions grew by 58 per cent during 1994 to 2007\n- It covers the sectors of Energy, Industry, Agriculture, Land Use Land Use Change and Forest and Waste by sources and removal by sinks presented in this document.",

This would entail reducing uncertainties of GHC emission coefficients in key source categories.\n- Identification of key steps to be taken towards implementing the Convention.\n- Vulnerabilty and adaptation assessment for presentation of information on specific needs and concerns arising from the adverse impacts of climate change.\n- Creation of reliable and comprehensive database for all the outputs produced through the establishment of a 'Data Centre' (DC). This information will be accessible on the Internet.\n- Enhancement of capacity to respond to projected climate change through the preparation of a 'Targeted Research Proposal' for developing a medium to longterm action plan.\n\n\n## GHG Inventory Estimations\n\n- In accordance with the provisions of Article-4 and 12.1 of UNFCCC, preparation of inventories of a basket of gases has been started for the areas of energy, industrial processes, agriculture land use and land use change and forestry (LULUCF) and waste.\n- The gases to be inventoried include carbon dioxide methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbon and sulphur hexafluoride released from various anthropogenic sources of the base year 1994.\n- This is in addition to estimating historical trends of GHG growth as a part of the initial National Communication to UNFCCC.\n- The estimation of national GHG inventories for all sectors is based on the 1996 guidelines of the 'Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change' (IPCC) and as good practices guidelines.\n\n\n## Do you know?\n\nStrengthening of ecological security is one of the goal of the Mahatma Gandhi Rural Employment Guarantee Programme (MGNREGA). MGNREGA is designed to strengthen ongoing efforts in the areas of water harvesting, watershed management and soil health care and enhancement.\n\n### 22.8. INDIA'S POLICY STRUCTURE RELEVANT TO GHG MITIGATION\n\n## 1. Integrated Energy Policy\n\n- India has in place a detailed policy, regulatory, and legislative structure that relates strongly to GHG mitigation: The Integrated Energy Policy was adopted in 2006.\n- Some of its key provisions are:\n- Promotion of energy efficiency in all sectors\n- Emphasis on mass transport\n- Emphasis on renewables including biofuels plantations\n- Accelerated development of nuclear and hydropower for clean energy\n- Focused R\\&D on several clean energy related technologies\n\n\n## 2. The Rural Electrification Policy, 2006\n\n- It promotes renewable energy technologies where grid connectivity is not possible or cost-effective. The New and Renewable Energy Policy, 2005, promotes utilization of sustainable, renewable energy sources, and accelerated deployment of renewables through indigenous design, development and manufacture.\n- The National Environment Policy, 2006, and the Notification on Environment Impact Assessment (EIA), 2006, reform India's environmental assessment regime. A number of economic activities are required to prepare environment impact assessments, and environment management plans, which are appraised by regulatory authorities prior to start of construction. The EIA provisions strongly promote environmental sustainability\n\n\n## Several other provisions\n\n- It relates to reforming energy markets to ensure that energy markets are competitive, and energy prices reflect true resource costs. These include: Electricity Act 2005, Tariff Policy 2003, Petroleum \\& Natural Gas Regulatory Board Act, 2006, etc.",

INTRODUCTION OF LABELLING PROGRAMME FOR APPLIANCES\n\n## Do you know?\n\nThe UN General Assembly on 23.01.95 adopted a resolution which proclaims 16th September as the International Day for the Preservation of the Ozone Layer, to commemorate the signing of the Montreal Protocol on the Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer which was signed on 16th September, 1987\n\n- An energy labelling programme for appliances was launched in 2006, and comparative star-based labelling has been introduced for fluorescent tube-lights, air conditioners, refrigerators, and distribution transformers.\n- The labels provide information about the energy consumption of an appliance, and thus enable consumers to make informed decisions. The Bureau of Energy Efficiency has made it mandatory for refrigerators to display energy efficiency label and is expected to do so for air conditioners as well. The standards and labelling\npro-gramme for manufacturers of electrical appliances is expected to lead to significant savings in electricity annually.\n\n\n### 22.10. ENERGY CONSERVATION BUILDING CODE\n\n- An Energy Conservation Building Code (ECBC) was launched in May, 2007, which addresses the design of new, large commercial buildings to optimize the buildings' energy demand based on their location in different climatic zones. Commercial buildings are one of the fastest growing sectors of the Indian economy, reflecting the increasing share of the services sector in the economy.\n- Nearly one hundred buildings are already following the Code, and compliance with the Code has been incorporated into the mandatory Environmental Impact Assessment requirements for large buildings.\n- It has been estimated that if all the commercial space in India every year conform to ECBC norms, energy consumption in this sector can be reduced by 30-40\\%. Compliance with ECBC norms is voluntary at present but is expected to soon become mandatory.\n\n\n### 22.10.1. Green Building\n\n- Buildings are one of the major pollutants that affect urban air quality and contribute to climate change.\n- Human Habitats (Buildings) interact with the environment in various ways. Throughout their life cycles, from construction to operation and then demolition, they consume resources in the form of energy, water, materials, etc. and emit wastes either directly in the form of municipal wastes or indirectly as emissions from electricity generation.\n- Green building is the essence of which would be to address all the pollution related issues of a building in an integrated and scientific manner.\n- A green building depletes as little of the natural resources during its construction and operation.\n- The aim of a green building design is to:\n- Minimize the demand on non-renewable resources and maximize the utilization efficiency of these resources when in use, and\n- Maximize reuse and recycling of available resources\n- Utilization of renewable resources.\n- It costs a little more to design and construct a green building.",

    "content": "## The basic features\n\n- The system has been developed to help 'design and evaluate' new buildings (buildings that are still at the inception stages).\n- A building is assessed based on its predicted performance over its entire life cycle - inception through operation.\n- The stages of the life cycle that have been identified for evaluation are:\n\n\n## Rating system\n\n- GRIHA rating system consists of 34 criteria categorized under 4 categories.\n- They are\n\n1. Site Selection and Site Planning,\n2. Conservation and efficient utilization of resources,\n3. Building operation and maintenance, and\n4. Innovation points.\n\n- Eight of these 34 criteria are mandatory, four are partly mandatory, while the rest are optional. Each criterion has a number of points assigned to it.\n- It means that a project intending to meet the criterion would qualify for the points. Different levels of certification (one star to five stars) are awarded based on the number of points earned. The minimum points required for certification is 50 .\n\n\n## Do you know?\n\nMedini Puraskar Yojana - This award is given to Indian authors each year to encourage original works in Hindi on environment and its related subjects such as wildlife, water resources and conservation\n\n## The benefits\n\n- On a broader scale, this system, along with the activities and processes that lead up to it, will benefit the community at large with the improvement in the environment by reducing GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions, reducing energy consumption and the stress on natural resources.\n- Reduced energy consumption without sacrificing the comfort levels\n- Reduced destruction of natural areas, habitats, and biodiversity, and reduced soil loss from erosion etc.\n- Reduced air and water pollution (with direct health benefits)\n- Reduced water consumption\n- Limited waste generation due to recycling and reuse\n- Reduced pollution loads\n- Increased user productivity\n- Enhanced image and marketability\n\n\n## The challenges\n\n- The Indian building industry is highly de-centralized with people and/ or groups engaged in design, construction, equipment provision, installation, and renovation working together.\n- Each group may be organized to some extent, but there is limited interaction among the groups, thus disabling the integrated green design and application process.\n- Hence, it is very important to define and quantify sustainable building practices and their benefits.\n- It is also important to separate the role of different participants in ensuring that the building consumes minimal resources over its entire life cycle and leaves behind a minimal environmental footprint.\n\n\n## Do you know?\n\nAmrita Devi Bishnoi Wildlife Protection Award is given for significant contribution in the field of wildlife protection, which is recognised as having shown exemplary courage or having done exemplary work for the protection of wildlife.\n\n### 22.11. ENERGY AUDITS OF LARGE INDUSTRIAL CONSUMERS\n\n- In March 2007 the conduct of energy audits was made mandatory in large energy-consuming units in nine industrial sectors. These units, notified as \"des-ignated consumers\" are also required to employ \"certified energy managers\", and report energy con-sumption and energy conservation data annually.\n\n\n### 22.12. MASS TRANSPORT\n\n- The National Urban Transport Policy emphasizes extensive public transport facilities and non-motor-ized modes over personal vehicles. The expansion of the Metro Rail Transportation System in Delhi and other cities (Chennai, Bangalore, Jaipur, etc) and other mass",
