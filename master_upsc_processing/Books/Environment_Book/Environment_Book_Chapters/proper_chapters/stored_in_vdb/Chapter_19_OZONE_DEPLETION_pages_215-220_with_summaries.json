The chemical symbol of ozone is $\\mathrm{O}_{3}$.\nIt is found in two different layers of the atmosphere. Ozone in the troposphere is \"bad\" because it dirties the air and helps to form smog, which is not good to breathe. Ozone in the stratosphere is \"good\" because it protects life on Earth by absorbing some of the sun's harmful Ultra Violet (UV) rays.\nThe ozone layer is very important because the configuration of the ozone molecule and its chemical properties are such that ozone efficiently absorbs ultraviolet light, thus acting like a sun-screen.\n\nThe UV rays cause direct damage to the genetic material or DNA of animal and plant cells. Exposure of mammals to UV light has been shown to act on the immune system, thereby making the body more susceptible to diseases.\n\n## Do you know?\n\n- Hoolock Gibbon is the only ape found in India. Rest of the monkeys are all macaques and langurs. In India is distributed in the northeast India.\n- Palms are typically unbranched trees with only one trunk (columnar stem), called the \"caudex,\" which ends in a crown of large leaves.\n\nIn doing so, ozone protects oxygen at lower altitudes from being broken up by the action of ultraviolet light and also keeps most of the ultraviolet radiation from reaching the earth's surface.\n\nIt helps in reducing the risks of mutation and harm to plant and animal life. Too much UV rays can cause skin cancer and will also harm all plants and animals. Life on Earth could not exist without the protective shield of the ozone layer.\n\n### 19.1. OZONE DEPLETION\n\n### 19.1.1. Change in equilibrium\n\n- The equilibrium between the formation and destruction of ozone, has been upset by the influx of several substances into the atmosphere which react with ozone and destroy it.\n- The rate at which ozone is being destroyed is much faster than the rate at which it is being formed.\n- It implies that there is a significant decrease in the concentration of ozone in a particular region of the atmosphere, hence the name 'Ozone Depletion'.\n- The best example of such an Ozone Depletion is the atmosphere over the Antarctic which has only about 50 percent of the ozone that originally occurred there. The actual realization of ozone-depletion came only in 1985.\n\n\n### 19.1.2. Sources\n\nchlorofluorocarbons (CFCs):\nCFCs molecules are made up of chlorine, fluorine and carbon.\n\n## Where it is used?\n\nThey are used as refrigerants, propellents in aerosol sprays, foaming agents in plastic manufacturing, fire extinguishing agents, solvents for cleaning electronic and metallic components, for freezing foods etc .\nTwo-thirds of CFC is used as refrigerants while one-third is used as blowing agents in foam insulation products.",

    "content": "## Why CFCs are used?\n\nCFCs has a wide and varied application due to its properties like non-corrosiveness, non-inflammability, low toxicity and chemical stability, etc.\n\n## Lifetime \\& removal of CFCs\n\nUnlike other chemicals, CFCs cannot be eliminated from the atmosphere by the usual scavenging processes like photodissociation, rain-out and oxidation.\nIn fact, the residence time of CFCs in the atmosphere estimated to be between 40 and 150 years. During this period, the CFCs move upwards by random diffusion, from the troposphere to the stratosphere.\n\n## The escape of CFCs\n\nThe CFCs enter into the atmosphere by gradual evaporation from their source. CFCs can escape into the atmosphere from a discarded refrigerator. Since the CFCs are thermally stable they can survive in the troposphere. But in the stratosphere, they are exposed to UV radiation.\n\n## The chemical reaction\n\nThe molecules of CFCs when exposed to UV radiation break up, thus freeing chlorine atoms. A free chlorine atom reacts with an ozone molecule to form chlorine monoxide (ClO). The molecules of chlorine monoxide further combine with an atom of oxygen. This reaction results in the formation of an oxygen molecule $\\left(\\mathrm{O}_{2}\\right)$ and reformation of the free chlorine atom (CI).\n\n\n**[IMAGE: Diagram illustrating the chemical reactions involved in ozone depletion caused by CFCs.]**\n\n\n\nThe depletion of $\\mathrm{O}_{3}$ is catalytic. The element that destroys $\\mathrm{O}_{3}$ (i.e chlorine) is being reformed at the end of cycle. A single chlorine atom destroys thousands of ozone molecules before encountering reactive nitrogen or hydrogen compounds that eventually return chlorine to its reservoirs.\n\n## Do you know?\n\nBarking deer /common muntjac is the mammal with the lowest recorded chromosome number. It gives calls similar to barking, usually on sensing a predator. Status - least threatened.\n\n## CFC substitutes - characteristics\n\n- The substitute for CFCs should be safe, low cost, increased energy efficiency of CFC replacement technology, effective refrigerants with low ozone layer depletion potential (ODP) and low global warming potential (GWP).\n- CFC-12 (R-12) is a widely used refrigerant. HFC 134a (R-134a) is the most promising alternative (R143a) and (R-152a) can also be used.\n\n\n### 19.1.3. Nitrogen Oxides:\n\n## Source\n\nThe sources of nitrogen oxides are mainly explosions of thermonuclear weapons, industrial emissions and agricultural fertilizers.\n\n## The chemical reaction\n\nNitric oxide (NO) catalytically destroys ozone.\n\n\n**[IMAGE: Diagram showing the chemical reactions between nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and monoxide.]**\n\n\n\n## The escape of $\\mathrm{N}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$\n\nNitrous oxide $\\left(\\mathrm{N}_{2} \\mathrm{O}\\right)$ is released from solid through denitrification of nitrates under anaerobic conditions and nitrification of ammonia under aerobic conditions. This $\\mathrm{N}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$ can gradually reach the middle of the stratosphere, where it is photolytically destroyed to yield nitric oxide which in turn destroys ozone.",

The molecular chlorine formed in the above reaction can be broken down to atomic chlorine and the ozone depletion reaction would continue. The PSCs not only activate chlorine, but they also absorb reactive nitrogen. If nitrogen oxides were present they would combine with chlorine monoxide to form a reservoir of chlorine nitrate $\\left(\\mathrm{ClONO}_{2}\\right)$.\nDimer of chlorine monoxide: Stratospheric chlorine monoxide reacts with itself forming a dimer Cl 2 O 2 . This dimer is easily dissociated by sunlight, giving rise to free chlorine atoms which can further react to destroy ozone.\n\nEvery spring, a hole as big as the USA develops in the ozone layer over Antarctica, in the South Pole. A smaller hole develops each year over the Arctic, at the North Pole. And there are signs that the ozone layer is getting thinner all over the planet.\n\n### 19.1.5. Why is the Ozone Depletion predominant at the Antarctic?\n\n- The Antarctic stratosphere is much colder. The low temperature enables the formation of Polar stratospheric Clouds (PSCs), below 20 km .\n- Ozone absorbs sunlight, causing the characteristic increase in temperature with increase in altitude in the stratosphere. If ozone is being depleted, the air becomes cooler, further adding to the favourable conditions for the formation of PSCs and stabilization of the vortex. The vortex is a ring of rapidly circulating air that confines the ozone depletion in the Antarctic region.\n- The longetivity of the Antarctic vortex is another factor, enhancing favourable conditions for the depletion of ozone. The vortex remains, in fact, throughout the polar winter, well into midspring whereas the vortex in the Arctic disintegrates by the time the polar spring (MarchApril) arrives.\n- Typical happenings in the winter months leading to the Ozone Depletion over the Antarctic.\n- In June Antarctic winter begins, the vortex develops and the temperature falls enough for the clouds to form.\n- During July and August PSCs denitrify and dehydrate the stratosphere through precipitation, hydrochloric acid\nand chlorine nitrate react on cloud surfaces to free chlorine and winter temperatures drops to their lowest point.\n- In September sunlight returns to the centre of the vortex as the austral spring begins and PSCs disappear because of increasing temperature. $\\mathrm{ClO}-\\mathrm{ClO}$ and $\\mathrm{ClO}-$ BrO catalytic cycles destroy ozone.\n- During October lowest levels of ozone are reached.\n- In November, Polar vortex breaks down, ozone-rich are from the mid-latitudes replenishes the Antarctic stratosphere and ozone-poor air spreads over the southern hemisphere.\n\n\n### 19.1.6. Arctic Ozone Depletion\n\n- The Ozone Depletion has been increasingly evident over the Arctic as well.\n- The Arctic Ozone Depletion which swept across Britain in March 96 was the greatest depletion of ozone ever seen in the northern hemisphere.\n- Scientists claim that it had been caused, in past, by a dramatic cooling of the upper atmosphere in the northern latitudes over.\n- The ozone depletion over the northern hemisphere has been increasing steadily since the winter of 1992.\n- Apart from the build-up of ozone depleting chemicals, the main cause is the increasing cold temperature in the arctic stratosphere which encourages the formulation of PSCs.\n\n\n## How ozone is measured?\n\n- The ozone measurement instruments and techniques are varied. Some of them are the Dobson spectrophotometer and the filter ozonometer called M83, and total ozone mapping spectrometer (TOMS) in the Nimbus-7 satellite.\n\n\n## The Umheher technique\n\n- The most common measure of total ozone abundance is the Dobson unit (named after the pioneering atmospheric physical Gordon Dobson) which is the thickness of the ozone column (compressed at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP)) in milli-centimeters. At STP one Dobson unit is equal to 2.69 x 1020 molecules per square meter.",

Experiments in animals show that UV exposure decreases the immune response to skin cancers, infectious agents and other antigens and can lead to unresponsiveness upon repeated challenges.\n- In susceptible (light-skin coloured) populations, UV-B radiations is the key risk factor for development of nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC).\n\n\n## Do you know?\n\nAll the chameleons have the ability to change color whenever they are subject to changes in stimuli, like a change in light, temperature or emotion. For example, when angered, they are likely to become darker in color.\n\n## Effects on terrestrial plants\n\n- Psychological and developmental processes of plants are affected by UV-B radiation.\n- Response to UV-B also varies considerably among species and also cultivars of the same species. In agriculture, this will necessitate using more UV-B tolerant cultivars and breeding new ones.\n- In forests and grasslands, this is likely to result in changes in the composition of species; therefore there are implications for the biodiversity in different ecosystems.\n- Indirect changes caused by UV-B such as changes in plant form, biomass allocation to parts of the plant,\ntiming of developmental phases and second metabolism may be equally or sometimes more important that the damaging effects of UV-B.\n\n\n## Effects on aquatic ecosystems\n\n- Exposure to solar UV-B radiation has been shown to affect both orientation mechanisms and motility in phytoplankton, resulting in reduced survival rates for these organisms.\n- Solar UV-B radiation has been found to cause damage in the early developmental stages of fish, shrimp, crab, amphibians and other animals. The most severe effects are decreased reproductive capacity and impaired larval development.\n\n\n## Effects on bio-geochemical cycles\n\n- Increases in solar UV radiation could affect terrestrial and aquatic bio-geochemical cycles, thus, altering both sources and sinks of greenhouse and chemically important trace gases.\n- These potential changes would contribute to bio-sphere atmosphere feedbacks that reinforce the atmospheric build-up of these gases.\n\n\n## Effects on air quality\n\n- Reduction in stratospheric ozone and the concomitant increase in UV-B radiation penetrating to the lower atmosphere result in higher photo dissociation rates of key trace gases that control the chemical reactivity of the troposphere.\n- This can increase both production and destruction of ozone $\\left(\\mathrm{O}_{3}\\right)$ and related oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide $\\left(\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{2}\\right)$, which are known to have adverse effects on human health, terrestrial plants, and outdoor materials.\n- Changes in the atmospheric concentrations of the hydroxyl radical $(\\mathrm{OH})$ may change the atmospheric lifetimes of climatically important gases such as methane $\\left(\\mathrm{CH}_{4}\\right)$ and the CFC substitutes.)\n- Increased tropospheric reactivity could also lead to increased production of particulates such as cloud condensation nuclei, from the oxidation and subsequent nucleation of sulphur, of both antropogenic and natural origin (e.g. carbonyl sulphide and dimethylsulphide.",
